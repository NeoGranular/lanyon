### About us

Just two guys (+1 editor) who love Xianxia trying to give back to the community. Right now we are quite busy but soon will catch speed.

You can subscribe to the blog with [Atom/RSS](http://weletranslation.com/atom.xml). E-Mail notifications are coming soon!

Immortal Executioner is translated almost entirely by hand, aside from the occasional glance into a dictionary ;) .

Currently active on this site are *NG* (*NeoGranular*) and *wele's editor*. The translator of Heaven Awakening Path is likely soon to follow and will then be listed here. If you want to contact us, simply leave a comment on our [Suggestions](http://weletranslation.com/suggestions.html) page, we will reply to all comments there.

#### The site is currently in an experimental stage. Once we have finalized the website, we will make an announcement post on weletranslation.com as well as our [Wordpress](http://weletranslation.wordpress.com).
