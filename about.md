### About us

Just two guys (+1 editor) who love Xianxia trying to give back to the community. Right now we are quite busy but soon will catch speed.

## Follow Us
You can subscribe to the blog with [Atom/RSS](http://weletranslation.com/atom.xml). You can follow this blog with WordPress, simply by adding weletranslation.com to your feed, WordPress will automatically detect our atom.xml (WordPress E-Mails are unavailable for this method). We will continue to maintain our WordPress announcement posts, which will link to this new site, so you can also follow us on [our old WordPress blog](https://weletranslation.wordpress.com), but that is not recommended. You can also subscribe to our e-mail notifications with [FeedBurner](https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=Weletranslations/main&amp;loc=en_US)!

Immortal Executioner is translated almost entirely by hand, aside from the occasional glance into a dictionary ðŸ˜‰.

Currently active on this site are *NG* (*NeoGranular*) and *wele's editor*. If you want to contact us, simply leave a comment on our [Suggestions](http://weletranslation.com/suggestions.html) page, we will reply to all comments there. We are constructing a 'Contact Us' site at the moment, on which you will be able to get in contact with us privately.

#### The site is currently in an experimental stage. Once we have finalized the website, we will make an announcement post on weletranslation.com as well as our [Wordpress](http://weletranslation.wordpress.com).

##### About Cookie usage on weletranslation.com

We are currently using Google Analytics while the site is still under construction. We will most likely remove it once our website is finalized, but we will make it very clear if we decide to continue using Analytics. Google Analytics uses a cookie that can track your activity across *only* our website. This cookie is a session cookie, which means as soon as you close your browser, this cookie will be deleted. All of this data is anonymized and aggregated, the information is not passed on to third parties.

We are also using a session cookie to save which theme (dark or light) you have set. That cookie is also deleted as soon as you close your browser. This theme cookie is *only* set, if you are actually changing the default theme.

All of our cookies are set exclusively with JavaScript. To stop cookies from being set, you can disable JavaScript or cookies in your browser settings. Here's an [example](http://www.howtogeek.com/63721/how-to-block-all-cookies-except-for-sites-you-use/).
