As if the time started at this instant, all the bandits simultaneously felt an intense trepidation.

They were not fools, and upon witnessing this scene, even a fool could tell that the group they had encountered was anything but ordinary.

Actually, Boss Liao was an eighth layer expert. Although comparing him with He Yiming and the rest would be unjust, at the very least, he shouldn’t have been crushed to death by a three hundred and sixty jin heavy chopper.

However, he’d underestimated the sack too much. Upon seeing He Yiming effortlessly tossing it several meters high and twenty meters far, it was simply impossible for him to think that this thing’s weight was so frighteningly high.

Moreover, while throwing, He Yiming had ingeniously used Jin Dao to aim at his head specifically.
(Tl: Jin-> Energy here)

Only under the combination of all these conditions had Boss Liao, an eighth layer expert, died in such a mysterious way, not understanding his death till the last moment.
