Since last time, after she had performed the pair cultivation with Yang Chen, she had started avoiding Yang Chen with the excuse of refining his flying sword, because she was afraid of meeting Yang Chen.

But this time, in the campaign against Lin Chenghe, Gao Yue feared for Yang Chen having some mishap. She knew that Yang Chen had the ability to invite disasters, therefore she had been sticking to Yang Chen’s side, sternly and carefully looking after him; in short: trying to avoid having Yang Chen harmed by anyone.

But when Cheng Wencai tried to underestimate Yang Chen and with Gao Yue’s disposition, she naturally became angry and immediately lost her self control. All of a sudden this had become a matter of honor for master and disciple.
