“You are Yang Chen of the Pure Yang Palace?”

That female disciple of the  Green Jade Immortal Island had a huge change in her complexion after hearing Yang Chen’s name. She wanted to confirm whether he really was Pure Yang Palace’s Yang Chen.

This time Yang Chen did not want to cause any trouble, he only wanted to cultivate peacefully and had come here to meet with Sun Qing Xue while passing by, to warn her not to covet a quick increase in her cultivation by cultivating that Long Tai Spirit Supporting Method, he only had this goal and nothing more.

On the whole journey Yang Chen was entirely content by himself, on one side observing everything and sensing the changes in heaven, earth and natural law, and on the other side, hastening on his journey.
