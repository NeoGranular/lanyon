Insight into Elder Wu’s cultivation? This was the entire cultivation experience left behind by a Da Cheng stage expert who was just about to ascend! This would be considered as a treasure among treasures at any sect, even if someone wanted to exchange it for a rare cultivation method, obtaining it was still impossible.

But Elder Wu had set it aside for Yang Chen just before ascending? The three were staring at the jade slips like people who hadn’t eaten and were seeing a meat bun. Being shocked to the extreme, they could not even dare to believe it.

“This, is it really Elder Wu’s?”
Gao Yue was the person with the lowest cultivation among the three and also was the most impatient one, naturally she was the first to ask.
