The color of the sky had evidently started to darken. However, it didn’t affect He Yiming and Xie Grace much. With their strength, even if the color of the sky turned completely dark, they could easily see their surroundings with the help of starlight.

After a hour, Xie Gracing, who was leading the way, eventually stopped and pointed at a huge tree, “We’re here.”

He Yiming felt apprehensive inwardly. At the time of leaving, this man had claimed an early return before Xie Mingjin and rest. However, they had continuously rushed through the forest for an hour before finally arriving at the lair of the long-armed raccoons. Adding in the time to return, this simply couldn’t even be associated with an early return.

He faintly shook his head. However, since they had already arrived, he’d no intentions of complaining.

“Mr. Xie, why you wished to come here? Is there some treasure here?” He Yiming said with a chuckle.

Xie Grace said in a grave voice, “Whether there is treasure or not is hard to say. However, I’ve come here due to seek confirmation of the words contained in a certain medical book of my clan.”

He Yiming was quite curious but since the counterpart had said clan’s book, he felt too awkward to ask another question.

Xie Grace arrived underneath the tree. With a slight jump, his body quickly climbed up the tree. After a few moments, his pleasantly surprised voice could be heard down below, “Brother He, quickly come up. We’ve found some good stuff.”
