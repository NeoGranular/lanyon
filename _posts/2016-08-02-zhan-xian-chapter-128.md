“It was me, why?”

Zhou Sulan was startled, she hadn’t thought that Yang Chen would call the cultivation method of the sect in question. But this matter concerned her favourite disciple, so she did not care that much about Yang Chen’s tone, which lacked the proper courtesy and she asked him with knitted brows:

“Why, is there some problem with this cultivation method?”

“First wood is first wood, second wood is second wood. Senior, aren’t you making Sun QingXue bite more than she can chew? What about not making her cultivate many cultivation methods? Why are you making her cultivate a cultivation method which contains both first wood and second wood together?”

Yang Chen turned around and asked Zhou Sulan in an extremely discontent tone.

“Cultivating first wood and second wood together? How is that possible?”

Zhou Sulan asked with great alarm:

“This clearly is a first wood cultivation method!”
