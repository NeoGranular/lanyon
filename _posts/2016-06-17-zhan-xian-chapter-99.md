Penglai Divine Wood, this was a legendary resource and surprisingly it had appeared within this pill? How was this possible? All of the YuanYing stage elders wished that they could immediately grab this pill and investigate it properly, only the status of the Palace Master was stopping them from this, as doing this would indeed be going too far, but still they had completely surrounded the Palace Master.

A foundation stage pill, even a third grade foundation stage, didn’t hold much value for them, as they had already reached the foundation stage countless years ago. At most Yang Chen’s ability to refine a third grade pill would be considered as an extremely gifted disciple within the sect who should be cultivated very carefully.

But Penglai Divine Wood was different, it could be used to refine the most powerful of flying swords. If a wood attributed cultivator got it by luck, then it simply could be considered as one of the very best magic weapons in the mortal world.
