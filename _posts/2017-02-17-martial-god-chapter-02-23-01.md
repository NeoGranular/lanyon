Sun shined brightly, the trees stood calm and stationary, and the beautiful lands lay serenely.

However, this secluded courtyard was pervaded by an aura which almost seemed substantive. Fortunately, all the servants and workers in the vicinity of this courtyard had already been moved to somewhere else. Otherwise, the transformation occurring at this moment would have brought an disastrous impact on them.

In the secluded room, He Yiming’s body had turned into a furnace. The fire type Internal Energy was being exhibited to the extreme, seeming as if He Yiming’s body itself was burning as fuel.

The clothes on his body had turned into ashes, even the mat under his buttocks had suffered a fatal disaster.

Fortunately, the four walls of this room were made of stone and bricks. If they had been made of wood, they probably wouldn’t have survived.

He Yiming, however, inwardly brimmed with hope and expectations at this moment. He could feel that Blaze technique’s power had already reached the limit but under the catalyzation and addition of Withered Tree technique’s power, this technique’s power was still climbing up.
