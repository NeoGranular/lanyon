Basically all the small countries to the west of the north-western countries had sections of the mountain range that was stretched across the whole north-western region. However, apart from these sections, the regions to the north were evenly stretched grasslands for the most part.

Heaven Sieve country was also one such country. Tai Cang county and Atai county were both considered to be a part of the Jadeting region. However, the difference between them was that unlike Tai Cang county, Atai county was mostly constituted of even land rather than the mountains.

Furthermore, the border between Heaven Sieve country and Kairong country was also here.

Kairong country was but one of the three great nations of the northwest. Their strength was far beyond that of Heaven Sieve country.

The horse bandits of Atai county also usually avoided the caravans from Kairong country. As a result, the troops of Kairong country usually turned a blind eye to the activities of these horse bandits, not willing to spend too much energy to completely eradicate them.

However, as far as Heaven Sieve country was concerned, these horse bandits were undoubtedly a huge,  poisonous tumor. Unfortunately, regardless of how they tried, under the lack of cooperation from the troops of Kairong country, they couldnâ€™t eliminate this tumor in its entirety.
