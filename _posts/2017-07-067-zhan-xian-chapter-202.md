  Yang Chen didn’t listen to Shangguan Feng’s proposal and went to his master’s place first. Upon seeing his master again, he was happy. 
   
Gao Yue had already reached foundation stage in water attributed cultivation. This had also put Gao Yue at a loss, even if she had elixirs and her JieDan stage spiritual awareness to help, reaching foundation stage after a short nine years. This speed could astonish anyone. 
   
Even Gongsun Ling who was known as a cultivation genius inside the sect and  had a nearly full earth attributed spirit root, had taken a full ten years to reach foundation stage from qi layer. But Gao Yue knew very well that she clearly had fire attribute spirit root, so how could she cultivate water attributed cultivation methods so quickly?
