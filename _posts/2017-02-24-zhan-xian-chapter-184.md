For Gao Yue and Gongsun Ling, this was the first time someone was targeting them. Gao Yue was still fine compared to Gongsun Ling, she had the experience of someone attacking her at the Great NanHuang Mountains, Gongsun Ling never had such experience.

Experienced Gao Yue hated such kind of actions even more, especially right now when these people were targeting Yang Chen, she abhorred him even more. Unconsciously, Gao Yue and Yang Chen both people’s mind were set on each other more seriously, thinking that they can allow themselves to be hurt but not the other person.  

Moreover it was Gongsun Ling’s first time facing deathly battle within the cultivator’s world, although she had already experienced sect’s martial art competition and had also tempered herself at Immortal Falling Well, but this was her first time fighting a life or death battle. But what astonished Yang Chen was that, even under these circumstances, Gongsun Ling didn’t seem the slightest bit nervous, rather she seemed to be looking forward to it.
