He Yitian’s face slowly gravened. Although he hadn’t seen the appearance of a gold core before, after smelling this fragrance which could jolt one’s spirit and mind, he immediately knew that this thing must be worth quite a bit.

“What is this?”

“Gold core.”

“Gold core?” He Yitian suddenly jumped to his feet, and his vision became astonished and unconvinced. Thinking for a bit, he said, “Sixth brother, this is that gold core which can allow people to cross over bottlenecks?”

He Yiming faintly shook his head and said, “No, eldest brother. Those are called Limit gold cores, and the one in my hand is actually Essence gold core.”

A trace of disappointment flickered on He Yitian’s face  as he casually asked, “What is this thing used for?”

"An Essence gold core is a kind of medicinal pill that could increase essence in the body. After consumption, it would immediately provide a huge increase in essence. Cultivating during this time period would allow one to quickly increase the Internal Energy, and even attain the peak of the current layer.” He Yiming grimly replied.
