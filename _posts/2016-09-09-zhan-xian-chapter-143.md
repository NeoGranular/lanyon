Last time, when Yang Chen had planted the PengLai divine wood in the Medicine Garden, there were huge changes in the space of the Medicine Garden, but after the Blood Phantom Vine had been planted, there was virtually no change. This baffled Yang Chen.

But after some time he understood the reason: originally the majority of herbs growing in the Medicine Garden were of the second wood attribute. If the Blood Phantom Vine, a spirit object which also had the second wood was added, then it would not trigger any major changes.

But after possessing the Blood Phantom Vine, the Medicine Garden was as secure as Mount Tai. Even if it didnâ€™t have the defensive spell of the dome. Without knowing a method to deal with the Blood Phantom Vine, if any person burst into the Medicine Garden, they would not come out unscathed. Growing the Blood Phantom Vine was just like growing a natural bodyguard.
