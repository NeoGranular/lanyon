Although this group consisted of a tenth layer, peak Houtian expert, He Yiming neither felt happy nor sad about it. He didn’t care much about it at all.

Relying on his two Xiantian battle skills, even if a fight erupted between the two sides, he definitely wouldn’t be at the bottom end of it.

The middle-aged man’s eyes exuded a strand of strange light, which lingered on He Yiming’s body for a moment.
