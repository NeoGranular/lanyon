Fan Vastsun suddenly raised his head and looked at He Quanxin with an completely undisguised hostility in his eyes.

Everybody who saw such a deeply hateful expression, felt a bit strange and could tell at a glance that the remaining half of this person’s life would pass in the shadow of revenge.

He Quanxin shuddered. Even with his present tenth layer cultivation base, he couldn’t help but feel a chill hitting him in the face.

“This is my Xiao uncles’ armguards. Where did you get them from?” Fan Vastsun gnashed his teeth and asked.

He Quanxin’s brows faintly creased. Inwardly, he was full of questions as well.

These two armguards had been nimbly slipped onto his arms by He Yiming before entering the field.

However, He Yiming’s movements were just too quick. Not to mention others, even he himself only realized after the event. However, at that time, it was no longer possible to question the origins of these armguards.
