Asking for the Real Sun Fire from He LianYun clearly illustrated one point: That Elder Wu was extremely satisfied with Yang Chenâ€™s exceptional work this time.

But naturally, asking for the flame from He LianYun would give rise to his resent, even though he was also one of the guests invited by Elder Wu. But Elder Wu was worthy of being called Elder Wu, he immediately gave him a way out, that was that he would look for a Flame for He LianYun before ascending.

He Lianyun wanted to offer some other things to Yang Chen in order to not lose his Real Sun Fire and he had nearly succeeded in preserving his fire, but after Elder Wu had asked, all of his plans had flown out of the window. But with Elder Wu promising him to look for a new flame, beneath his hidden anger, He LianYun was also a little grateful.
