This kind of point allocation by the institute was certainly reasonable. Lu Ping was an ordinary passerby. One point for him was to ensure that everybody's effort will not be in vain; it could be considered as a consolation. Xi Fan, even though had the realm of sixth Heavenly Layer in the Essence's soul that was the most difficult soul to perceive, he would clearly have trouble moving due to sitting in a wheelchair. Therefore, he'd only been allocated two points. Mo Lin had the sixth Heavenly Layer in the Pivot's soul and also had the ability to move freely, thus four points for him. Su Tang had the sixth Heavenly Layer in the Strength's soul, her movements and fighting strength would be comparatively better than Mo Lin, thus, she'd two extra points, which was also the highest  among the four.
