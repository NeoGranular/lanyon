A Spell Formation deployed by the Greatest Heaven Sect had been discovered by some random chance at this place, when a YuanYing stage senior together with some guests of another sect which had mediated in the war, were passing through there and were attacked by the Spell Formation.

An attack on the guests of the Five Phases Sect was a direct provocation to the authority of the Five Phases Sect. The YuanYing stage ancestor had directly attacked and broke down the Spell Formation in his bottomless fury, even getting rid of a JieDan expert of the Greatest Heaven Sect. Simultaneously they seemed to have also killed a Foundation stage junior, who was found decapitated and was not a disciple of the Greatest Heaven Sect.

All of the dead bodies were discovered at the scene and the Spell Formation was in a complete mess. Nobody knew why the two JieDan experts had attacked this YuanYing stage ancestor of the Five Phases Sect at this time, the body of that Foundation stage cultivator was also a riddle, but one thing was absolutely clear: the Greatest Heaven Sect was in great trouble this time.
