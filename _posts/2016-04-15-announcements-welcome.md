Here are a few tips for using our site:

* To see the site with a white background and black text, put a tick  in the side menu ( â˜° ) here: "â˜‘ Light Theme"
* Our site is *almost* fully functional without JavaScript. We use JavaScript for changing themes, disqus comments, AdSense and Analytics.
* You may comment as guest in disqus, but we will manually approve guest comments by hand, so it may take some time for them to appear.

If you want to support our site, please consider turning off your ad blocker or donating. We're currently re-working our donation page to make it more pleasing to the eye.

Thank you for your support and for reading here! Have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
