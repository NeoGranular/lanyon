“Huh?”

Wang Yong who had just found Gao Yue, was surprised to discover Yang Chen just after inspecting the condition of Gao Yue’s injuries.

He had originally thought that he would meet Yang Chen a few days later, but he hadn’t expected that Yang Chen would come this quickly. But Yang Chen had always exceeded his expectations, so this did not count for much.

“How is master’s condition?”

Yang Chen sprinted to Wang Yong’s side and anxiously looked at Gao Yue, who was within Wang Yong’s hands. Gao Yue’s hands and feet were drooping on the side at this moment and her complexion was deathly pale, there was almost no liveliness.
