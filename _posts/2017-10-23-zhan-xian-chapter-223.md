Standing outside the Seven Star Godly Thunder Spell, Yang Chen halted for a moment as if trying to find the direction of lightning within the spell formation. Soon after, two red balls twice the size of fist appeared in his hands. 

“What’s that?”

Standing behind him, the pupils of the group of the expert shrank:

“Thunder pomegranate?”

Thunder pomegranate can absorb lightning, because of this property, many people try to find some thunder pomegranate when undergoing lightning tribulation and use it absorb some lightning. 

Although Seven Star Godly Thunder Formation is formidable, but in the end it is nothing but the strength of lightning and thunder. The thunder pomegranates can absorb lightning and thunder, there is no doubt about this, but wanting to break the Seven Star Godly Thunder Spell with nothing but thunder pomegranate is nothing but Yang Chen being delusional.

Leaving aside the fact that this spell formation has been set by a Dacheng expert, the amount of power of thunder and lightning ingested by this spell formation for the past millennium years was unimaginable. Even if Dacheng expert enters it, they could only focus on self preservation and nothing else. Although it was unpleasant to hear, but only two thunder pomegranate were not enough to even get stuck between the teeth of this Seven Star Godly Thunder Spell.

Whoosh whoosh, under Yang Chen’s control, both thunder pomegranates flew within the spell formation. Once the spell formation sensed that some foreign object has entered spell formation and it doesn’t comply with the unique route set by spell, the spell formation immediately began to attack. With rumbling sound, the omnipresent lightning rushed towards the two thunder pomegranates.
