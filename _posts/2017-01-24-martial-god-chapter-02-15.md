The disappointment in He Yiming’s eyes didn’t contain a trace of pretense, nor did he try to gloss it over in the slightest.

As Xie Grace saw He Yiming’s expression, he suddenly thought of a certain matter. However, as he carefully analyzed He Yiming’s age, he immediately discarded it.

Even he wouldn’t dare believe that He Yiming’s Internal Energy had already attained the tenth layer.

He faced upwards and chuckled, “Brother He, don’t tell me even these two long-armed raccoons can’t appease you?”

He Yiming shrugged. He indeed didn’t feel too excited. However, he also knew that being able to locate two long-armed racoons was already extraordinary. As for a five-hundred-year-old beast, the possibility of finding such a beast was almost zero. One could say that such a beast could only be met, not sought.
