The cave was crude and the Spirit Power in this place was lacking? Hearing Yang Chen say such a blunt evaluation, Gao Yue could not help but open her eyes widely. She was looking at Yang Chen as if looking at someone whom she had never met before. Naturally, as a matter of fact, today was just the first day of properly meeting each other for Yang Chen and Gao Yue, so this was not normal.

“Master, relax the restrictions on your heart. This disciple knows a suitable cave for cultivation on Meiqing Mountain. Constructing a few Immortal Caves is nothing much, everything will be provided by this disciple!”

Yang Chen was very delighted and patted his chest, as if he had completely taken charge, without paying the slightest attention to the strange looks Gao Yue gave him.

“You know about a lot of things, right?”

Gao Yue was very smart, or how would she be Yang Chen’s master in his previous life? Looking at Yang Chen, she directly asked:

“Even the Palace Master and the others have said that you do not need much guidance from me in your cultivation, is that so?”
