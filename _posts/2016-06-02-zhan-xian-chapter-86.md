The temple was ruined, the images of its god had already fallen down, the walls were broken and destroyed and only an outline was left over. Every kind of vine was breaking out from everywhere, spiders could be found in all corners, it was very difficult to make people believe that this kind of place would have any relation with jewels and riches.

Perhaps because of this reason, Yang Xi’s grandfather had hidden them here; the capital he kept for emergencies; it would give rise to the suspicions of very few people.

The locust tree from below which Yang Chen had excavated the riches had already grown back. Ten year’s time was already sufficient for it to grow and become verdant and lush.
