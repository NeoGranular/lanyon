The red sun lay embedded inside the red clouds that were knitted by the red leaves. The branches slashed the azure sky into various ribbons that coiled around these red clouds and the sun.

In this charismatic landscape, He Yiming’s figure rushed through the plains like lightning and entered the Yuan manor.

Although the day was already resonant, He Yiming’s speed had reached an inconceivable degree. Even if some people saw him, they only felt a blur before their eyes and had absolutely no clue that a person had gone past them.

This was the result of the dao He Yiming had comprehended on the mountain peak, the Rain Cloud imprint- a new agility technique he’d created by combining the agility technique of Xiao brothers with the nature’s fine rain and clouds.

He Yiming immediately proceeded onto naming this technique Rain Cloud. Although this was officially the first technique he’d created, in regards to might, this technique was far above that of the Xiantian technique of the Xiao brothers.
