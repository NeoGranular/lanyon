Fortunately it wasn’t as big of a problem as the constituent spirit and was much easier to handle. But before he could formally begin the refining, he still had to think of a method to neutralize the inner dan’s toxicity.

The Profound Spirit Furnace had directly risen by one grade under the influence of the Spirit Power and medicinal power from refining the blue-green zoysia and still had the aura of a treasure as before and had already mixed with Spiritual Influence. The entire Profound Spirit Furnace was in the process of becoming a middle grade magic weapon from a low grade magic weapon, Yang Chen was convinced that after few layers of refining, it would become an amazing middle grade magic tool.
