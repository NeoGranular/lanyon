He Yiming palpitated. If not for the presence of other people, he would have already screamed.

However, his thoughts immediately shifted as he suspiciously said, “Many thanks for your guidance. However, since this is the case, have you not tried this method?”

Xie Zhien face immediately revealed a regretful expression as he said, “In my youth, I wholeheartedly indulged myself in alchemy. Although I made some accomplishments in alchemy, my Internal Energy cultivation was delayed as a result. My fire and wood type cultivation only reached the tenth layer at the age of eighty. By that time, my meridians had already solidified and vitality was dissipating. If I had still tried to breakthrough relying on this method, I’m afraid as soon as I’d absorbed the Worldly Qi in my body, it would have instantly exploded, and I would have died.”

He Yiming’s complexion slightly changed before he asked,”Could it be…..there is no method to resolve this?”
