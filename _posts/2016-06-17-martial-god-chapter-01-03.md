The day was already resonant by the time He Yiming returned to the He Family Estate.

He Family Estate a was well-reputed small village in its neighborhood. Old Residence Master, He Wude, was a tenth level expert in the Internal Energy cultivation. Within several hundreds of li of the county town, he was counted among the top most characters.

He Wude had three sons. Although they had distinctly attributed cultivation techniques, all the three possessed at least the eighth level in the Internal Energy cultivation. Furthermore, the eldest son, He Quanxin, had already attained the ninth level. Among the third generation, the eldest grandson of the eldest son, He Yitian, although was only twenty-one years old, he'd already cultivated his Internal Energy up to the seventh level. He was the number one figure amongst his peers regardless of any aspect.
