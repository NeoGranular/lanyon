This small piece of information gave rise to shock on the side of the Palace Master and his Great Master, Wang Yong. These continuous few bits of information were already something that they were not able to believe. Just a moment ago, they were feeling happy that their own disciple had prevailed over everything, but this matter about the two demon beasts wanting to enter the sect, could the Heavens really drop such a meat pie into their laps?

“If demon beasts enter my sect, won’t the people think that my Pure Yang Palace has some relations with demon beasts?”
Wang Yong was experienced and knowledgeable, he immediately called this into question. But his tone was not going against Yang Chen, rather wanting Yang Chen to overcome some barriers, or possibly wanting Yang Chen to justify these things.

The Palace Master also puckered his brows, this question, if not settled properly, would be a huge annoyance. Although he and Wang Yong did not care if Yang Chen had relied on these two YuanYing demon beasts to resolve this matter, in case people became aware that Pure Yang Palace was colluding with demon beasts, it would give rise to a great controversy. Let alone other people, the Greatest Heaven Sect would not let go of this opportunity and would try to retrieve some honour from the Pure Yang Palace.
