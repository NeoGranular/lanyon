The three individuals advanced towards the great courtyard; He Yitian and He Quanyi walking closely at either side of He Yiming.

After a few moments they had walked beside He Yiming, both experienced a strange feeling. The current He Yiming seemed different, but how? They simply didn’t have a clue.

However, after observing He Yiming during the walk, they were now convinced that He Yiming had indeed advanced. However, in any possible case, they simply couldn’t imagine that He Yiming had not actually advanced to the tenth layer, but Xiantian realm.

As He Yiming gently opened the entrance of the great courtyard, his face revealed a trace of queer smile.
He already knew that in the courtyard’s main hall, his grandfather was not alone. His eldest uncle He Quanxin and the old servant He Laibao were also here.

Upon hearing the news of his return, the two had  ignored the affairs of Book Pavilion.

“Grandfather, Grandpa Bao, eldest uncle.”

He Yiming performed a bow and brightly said.

“Quickly get up.” He Wude stood up from the mat and arrived before He Yiming, helping him up while carefully measuring him as well.

As He Yiming saw pale gray hair on his grandfather’s temples, he suddenly felt in his heart.
The old man had done as much as he could for the clan.

In a few months he’d not seen his grandfather, although the latter had not changed visibly, this feeling in his heart had increased to the extreme.

The twinkle in He Wude’s eyes increasingly brightened as his smile increasingly widened.

Eventually, he excitedly said, “Yiming, did you succeed?”

“Yes, grandfather.” He Yiming firmly said.

He Laibao and He Quanxin exchanged a glance. Their eyes revealed a trace of their emotionally stirred appearance.

He Wude didn’t lose his cool like He Yitian and only gave a heavy nod while saying, “He Yiming, you are good, quite good.”

He Yiming faintly smiled and suddenly said, “Grandfather, during this time’s trip, I didn’t progress in just cultivation, but also received other benefits.”

He Wude asked in an interested manner, “What benefits?”

In his mind, as long as He Yiming could smoothly advance, it would be sufficient. As for the other benefits, he didn’t care about it at all.

He Yiming took out a jade battle and handed it out, “Grandfather, the biggest benefit I’ve obtained is inside this.”
