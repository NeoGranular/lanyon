“Sword spell!”

With just one glance, Scarface could see that these five women were working in cooperation with each other. Clearly this was a high grade spell formation. Those henchmen falling before this was really not a shame.

However Scarface didn’t put them in his eyes. A few JieDan experts would never be able to suppress a YuanYing stage expert, Scarface firmly believed this.

Confronting those five women, Scarface didn’t even pull out his flying sword but instead formed a fist and had unleashed the Nanming armor for defense, which made the five women shudder.
