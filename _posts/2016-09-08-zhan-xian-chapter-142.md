“Yes, you!”

Yang Chen nodded and smiled towards that servant:

“You already have a strength at the seventh qi layer, if you can advance a few more layers, you will completely be able to become an inner disciple.”

Hearing these words, all of the servants who had followed after the outer disciples immediately became excited. But they still remembered their status and did not dare to cross their limits and merely looked at Yang Chen with a gaze full of hope.

“In the future, to any person in the Nine Earth Manor, including the people at the Ye Xiu Manor, if anyone has a problem, they can raise it in front of me.”

Yang Chen sternly said:

“Every two months, I will set aside a day at both the Ye Xiu Manor and the Nine Earth Manor. If you have anything you are not clear about, you can ask me.”
