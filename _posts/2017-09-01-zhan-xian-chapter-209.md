Apparently Sun Qingxue had only come this time to express his feelings towards Yang Chen. She also wanted to fight with Fairy Shi who had shown her kindness previously, to become dao companion, feeling weak in her heart, she decided to wait for Yang Chen. Although she couldn’t obtain any clear answer from Yang Chen, but still feeling relieved she returned back to her sect saying that she is returning to concentrate on cultivation. 

After sending off Sun Qingxue, Yang Chen finally got relieved of this big headache for the time being. After pondering for some time, he decided to not go out for some time and stay in the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard and cultivate properly.

Senior apprentice sister Gongsun Ling had also come out of closed door training some time ago, so Yang Chen went to pay a visit. Like Gao Yue, she also teased him for having great luck with women, but fortunately, she didn’t say much and asked him to recommend some secret books of spell formations which she can obtain and use and then again began her research.
