“Bang….”

Sharp and crisp sounds rang out in succession.

He Quanxin’s figure remained unmoved. Although his actions didn’t seem quick, the palm he’d stretched out perfectly issued a light slap on each of the four arms of the Xiao brothers separately.

However, the following result was out of everybody’s expectations.

This seemingly light slap actually issued brittle sounds in succession as if iron had been struck with stone. Moreover, Xiao brothers didn’t seem to be at a disadvantage at all.

He Quanxin’s face involuntarily gravened. He was inwardly astonished. Their four arms actually carried extremely strong Internal Energy. It was so strong that it didn’t pale even when compared to his own Internal Energy.

Although he hadn’t exerted himself completely, he’d not looked down on his opponents either. In front of his palm strikes that he’d issued just now, even a ninth layer could only have retreated. However, seeing the current energetic appearances of the two brothers, he couldn’t help but think to himself, ‘Could these two actually be tenth layer experts?’
