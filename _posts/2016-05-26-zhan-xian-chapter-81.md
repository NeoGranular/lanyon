For a pill to face tribulation was already a rare and unprecedented event, but that the pill was still capable of fleeing, this had overturned all knowledge these pill concocting masters had gained in their lives. It did not mean that all of what they had learnt was wrong, but this Heaven Seizing Pill was indeed opposing the heavens, something which really should not be in the hands of mortals.

The person who refined the Heaven Seizing Pill last time had not recorded the events after refining for some unknown reason, let alone these shapes in the air as well as passing through the tribulation, or about the pill escaping and so on. If Yang Chen had not heard about these things in the spiritual world, his knowledge would be similar to them and he would have believed that the refining had ended in failure.

But he had to admit, these three high grade pill concocting masters still had quite some achievements, most of all in their grasp over controlling the heat, but unfortunately, refining of the Heaven Seizing Pill did not only depend on success in controlling the temperature.
