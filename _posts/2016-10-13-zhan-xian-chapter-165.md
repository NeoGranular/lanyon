The main part of the vine in addition to the luxurious master root constituted the main vine. This main vine contained ninety percent of its strength, which would be used as the main material for the second wood flying sword.

If Yang Chen had not already spent so much time to subdue this Blood Phantom Vine just to obtain this master vine, getting it wouldnâ€™t have been so easy. Even after this, it would still take at least one month to completely take out this main vine.
