The status of these few people was absolutely clear, especially from the pile of clan’s cultivation method and other things within their qiankun pouch, there was no doubt left.

The clansmen surprisingly had the intention of kill Yang Chen and Gao Yue, it was not the time to go back to Palace Master Zhong Jiao and explain him. Just the fact that they had intended to target Gao Yue, they were already destined to fall.

Although the experts had died, but those few qi layer disciples were still alive. Seeing that the turn of events was far from encouraging, each and every one of them began to flee, unfortunately, under the spiritual awareness imprint of old tree demon, they haven’t even run several miles, before they captured by Yang Chen and his group who were flying on flying swords. Within less than half a day, all seven of them were lying down in front of Yang Chen and other two.
