The heavens and lands glimmered with the snow’s silver radiance, and the entire forest resembled a sculpture carved out of white marble.

As He Yiming stood in silence atop the snow-covered ground of the forest, facing the destruction that could only have been caused by an inhumane power, countless emotions welled up inside him.

Ever since he’d started cultivating Internal Energy, the strongest move he’d executed was undoubtedly that stunning blade strike which he’d carried out against that Gold-Crowned python and was produced by exhausting all the Internal Energy inside his body instantaneously and bringing out his body’s potential to the extreme.

However, after that day, he’d never produced such a powerful move again.

Even after accomplishing the greater success in five-phases techniques, he hadn’t been able to use this move again. Every time after accumulating his strength for a long time, he would be absolutely incapable of bringing it out instantaneously.

Today, he’d unexpectedly completed the refining of Reclining Moon Blade, integrated the fist concept of Silk Palm on a snowy day with the blade, then even produced a move that could only be described as world-shaking.
