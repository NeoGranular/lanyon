Although the mantle could hide his image, it had a fatal flaw: It could not be used during fights. If someone started fighting while wearing this, it would immediately break into pieces. This was also the reason why those people who were trying to steal could reveal the identity of their target.

The inside of the auction house was very large, but it didnâ€™t appear so from outside. Yang Chen knew that this was some kind of space, like the medicine garden, which had been refined by at least two Da Cheng stage experts. Only then could it have that size.
