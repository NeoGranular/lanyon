“Why is he talking so much? Let’s kill him quickly and run away, there are no people here!”

While he was talking, someone impatiently said this in a loud voice, soon after that, that person quickly moved.  

This one move of his initiated movements from everyone else, the flying swords of everyone pounced towards Yang Chen like flying locusts.

Yang Chen stood at the same place as before, waving his extremely vulgar executioner’s blade. One slash could chop a mountain, with the similarly vulgar style, he chopped down in front of him. As the same time as the chop, a smile appeared on Yang Chen’s face, as if his cherished desires had come true, making the expressions of people attacking him go bad.
