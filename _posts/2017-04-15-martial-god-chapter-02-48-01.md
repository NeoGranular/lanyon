He Yitian sucked in a deep breath. Not sparing a single glance for Fan Vastsun, he turned around and returned back to his position, and brightly said, “Father, son has returned victorious.”

He Quanxin heartily laughed and said, “Good, worthy of being my He family’s descendant.”

He was not stringent with the praise, but in his mind, he felt quite strange. He was naturally well aware of He Yitian’s cultivation. When did it advance so much?

Moreover, after watching the course of mutual Internal Energy consumption, he felt even more uncertain. He Yitian’s Essence was actually so prolonged. If it had been him, contending against him in mutual consumption with his Internal Energy restrained to the seventh layer, he would also have been whittled to death by this seemingly boundless Internal Energy.

Of course, now was not the time for inquiry. He could only save his doubts for the future.
