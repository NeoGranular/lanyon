Holding the Red Sun Metal Soul, Gao Yue began to refine the flying sword for Yang Chen again. Gao Yue had thought much about this flying sword and really wanted to complete it, at least in a few years.

With the Red Sun Metal Soul now, the main material of the flying sword was already complete only some assisting materials were remaining, but this time, Yang Chen did not dare to let Gao Yue go out to seek the materials alone again, and called out to She Kui and Xie Sha, asking them to take out all of the materials they had obtained at the Hao Yi Manor and give  them to Gao Yue to choose.

Despite already knowing that Yang Chen, She Kui and Xie Sha, together with Scarface and the old tree demon, had exterminated the Hao Yi Manor, upon seeing this many qiankun pouches being opened before their eyes, even the Palace Master and Wang Yong were alarmed.
