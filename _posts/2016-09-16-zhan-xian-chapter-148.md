Within the Palace Hall, Mo Qian and her disciples were still cultivating. Because they were cultivating within the palace hall which was rich in spirit power, their cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds in a short time.

The five JieDan stage experts were completely under Yang Chen’s control, only Mo Qian, their master, was left but she was also completely immersed in cultivation after Yang Chen’s simple hypnosis.

Although her cultivation was at the YuanYing stage, she was still a vegetable. This was a great waste. While Yang Chen was still unable to order Mo Qian around, like her disciples, a few simple attack moves were still possible.
