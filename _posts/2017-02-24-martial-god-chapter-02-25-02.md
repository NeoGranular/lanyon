Currently, Xie Mingjin’s small courtyard had been  restored. Except for the huge hatchway opened above that secluded room and a few stone-grinding marks, it looked exactly the same as before.

Xie Mingjin was personally living in this courtyard. However, he used one building at most.

He was quite apprehensive inwardly as well. He simply couldn’t assure himself that He Yiming would return. Although he knew that words of a Xiantian realm cultivator should hold some certainty, he was still quite troubled about the potential losses and was unable to calm down.

Suddenly, a laughter echoed in the courtyard, “Brother Xie, why are you alone here? Where did you send off all the servants?”
