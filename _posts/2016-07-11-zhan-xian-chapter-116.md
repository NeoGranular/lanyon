Everyone knew who Elder Wu was looking for. Apart from Yang Chen, the entire Pure Yang Palace didnâ€™t have anyone who had caught the eyes of Elder Wu.

Seeing this, there was no need to ask, this was surely a courtesy visit before ascending. Originally the status of the Pure Yang Palace was not sufficient for Elder Wu to show his appreciation, but because of Yang Chen, everything was different.

The main gate of the Pure Yang Palace was opened widely and all inner disciples were in formation. An extremely long greeting line was formed from the main gate extending all the way to the main hall.
