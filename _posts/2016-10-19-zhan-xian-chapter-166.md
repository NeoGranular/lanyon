The entire Second Wood flying sword’s body was the same color as the Blood Phantom Vine and it was also long. Although it was a bit soft, it was extremely tough. The master root had turned into the sword hilt and the master vine had turned into the sword blade.

It was a long sword blade, around six feet long, but one of its edges was the edge of a blade. From this it could be seen that this second wood flying sword was more of a saber than a sword. Even the edge of the saber was formed after the deformation of the Blood Phantom Vine’s master vine. Apart from possessing all of the abilities of the flying sword, this second wood flying sword also possessed the crazy strength of the Blood Phantom Vine.

Naturally, such a sword embryo was perfectly suited for Yang Chen, a reborn Great Principle Golden Immortal.
