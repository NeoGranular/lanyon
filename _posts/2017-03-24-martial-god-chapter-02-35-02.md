When He Yiming slowly walked out from the street’s opening, his face had gained its true appearance and even the body had completely reverted back to normal. As for the long gown on his body, he’d dumped it in some corner sometime along the way.

His figure faintly moved. The next moment, he was already inside one of the Yuan family’s shops. The shop’s assistant, who obviously recognized He Yiming, immediately struck a greeting.

He Yiming asked him to prepared a room where he could rest and further made him send someone to that antique shop along with the message for his eldest brother that he would be waiting here.

The servants in this shop naturally didn’t dare be neglectful and immediately made all the arrangements.

After entering the room prepared for him, the first task He Yiming did was precisely to open that package.

Inside was a box made from gold and iron. There was an exquisite chain on the box.

He Yiming coldy snorted and gave a gentle pull to the chain. The chain immediately broke apart. For a powerful Xiantian cultivator such as him, such shackles wouldn’t cause any complications even in the absence of a suitable key.

The box opened, revealing a round object wrapped in a cotton cloth.

With his brows faintly creased, He Yiming tore the cotton cloth, revealing a dark and seemingly devoid of luster, black stone.

Upon seeing this black stone, his expression turned into one of disbelief.
