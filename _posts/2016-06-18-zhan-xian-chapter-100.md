Together with that original qiankun pouch, the Palace Master delivered the Real Pure Yang Flame to Yang Chen. After Yang Chen had respectfully accepted it, the Palace Master waved his hand and immediately a divine light entered Yang Chen’s spirit sea, this was a chant used for opening the seals on the Real Pure Yang Fire.

“Foundation Stage, Third Grade Pill Concocting Master, Yang Chen, I will await the day when you refine the Real Pure Yang Fire!”
The Palace Master wasn’t pretending even a little while saying these words, he was indeed sincerely expecting this outcome.
“But you can only keep this for at most three hundred years. Once this time is over, it will automatically return to the secret pavilion of my Pure Yang Palace, so you must hurry up.”

“This disciple will surely try to do his best and not disappoint the Palace Master and the elders!”
Yang Chen immediately expressed his gratitude and determination, but in his mind he was thinking that it was really fortunate that he had taken out the branch of Penglai Divine Wood. If it hadn’t been for that, it would still take countless years before he could gain access to the Real Pure Yang Fire.
