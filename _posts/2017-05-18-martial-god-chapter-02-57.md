In a small town, there was usually only a single group in the best inn. They lived free and unrestrained, and the courtyard that the rich resided in was further and also the only one.

When two rich families encountered each other in such a place and neither was willing to back down, some struggle was to be ensued.

This moment, on the roadside before the inn, two bare-handed individuals were amidst a fierce confrontation. One among the two was naturally Yuan family’s sponger Zhong Puyan- a cultivator of the eighth layer. With his cultivation, he could receive a fine treatment in any influential family whatsoever. However, because of receiving great kindness from Yuan family in childhood, he willingly served Yuan family. Even in the current escort squadron, he was the expert with the most brilliant cultivation base.

The other individual was a middle-aged man in a skin tight outfit. He had exceptionally slim and narrow shoulders, long arms, long legs, and two long, chunk-like arms that dangled outside the sleeves.

However, his Internal Energy had also surprisingly attained eighth layer. Moreover, this person’s actions were vicious. His two long arms were like spider legs, every time they streaked in the air, a burst of strange air-cleaving sound whizzed through the air, seeming as if his arms were his weapon.

Zhong Puyan was evidently quite apprehensive about the middle-aged man’s arms. However, when he acted, his movements seemed light as a feather without any strength and was able to evade every time at the crucial moment.

Although both sides had begun, they seemed quite restrained and hadn’t truly gone for the kill.

Both of them could see that the opponent certainly had some origins. Under such circumstances, nobody was a fool that would kill his opponent without fearing the consequences.
