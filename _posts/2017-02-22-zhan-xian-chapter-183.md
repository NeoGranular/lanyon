“How should we take care of the debt of that clan and He LianYun.”

After calling in  Yang Chen, these were the first words of Palace Master Zhong Jiao:

“If anyone dares to accuse the disciples of my Pure Yang Palace unjustly and is let off so lightly, then wouldn’t my Pure Yang Palace would be considered as a pushover in future!”

Yang Chen was at Nine Earth Manor performing the duties of Merit Transferring Disciple, when he was suddenly called in by the Palace Master, on the way he kept thinking what kind of great affair had happened. Hearing Palace Master Zhong Jiao’s words, Yang Chen smiled and said:

“I think the sect shouldn’t pay any attention to this matter.”

“There shouldn’t be anyone who thinks that after accusing my Pure Yang Palace’s disciple and trying to steal our properly, they can still remain safe and sound!”

Palace Master Zhong Jiao smiled towards Yang Chen and said:

“They must pay their debts!”
