“Fellow daoist Yang, what kind of spirit beast do you want to use, choose without any hesitation, this place has the largest number of spirit beasts in the entire spirit beast market.”

Su Mosheng enthusiastically guided Yang Chen to the place where the spirit beasts of Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion were displayed:

“They don’t have ox family, but choose whomever you find suitable!”

Yang Chen smiled and nodded his head slightly and then begin to look at the highest grade spirit beasts of the Ten Thousand Beasts Pavilion, looking at each of them one by one, however he didn’t seem satisfied with any of them.

“What? None of these are suitable?”

When Yang Chen had spent almost two incense burning time in their and still hadn’t chosen one, Liu Yuanfeng came back from the rear courtyard and was unable to control himself but ask with some astonishment.
