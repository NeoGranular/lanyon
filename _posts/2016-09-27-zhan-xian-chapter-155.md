Hao Yi Manor had been completely razed to the ground, Scarface hadn’t left even a single person alive. The entire manor was like an impenetrable fortress being surrounded by the old tree demon, so nobody was able to escape.

That young manor master’s head was preserved properly by Yang Chen, who wanted to return it to his master. This mess of the Hao Yi Manor still required someone to straighten it, however.

There were dead bodies of thousands of people, as well as their belongings, which wouldn’t disappear with the dead bodies. Thus, with Scarface’s advice, Yang Chen and the others started gathering the spoils of battle.
