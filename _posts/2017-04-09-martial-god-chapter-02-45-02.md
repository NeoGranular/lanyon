Lu Xinwen faintly smiled and said, “Why are you paying respects to me?”

Fan Vastsun respectfully said, “Great granduncle, I admire your old self. I am not seeking to gain apprenticeship under you, but only wish to serve by you for a few days to fulfil my duty as a junior.”

Behind his body, Fan Shui was both astonished and delighted. If the former could gain a favourable impression of this old man, not to mention him, it would be an extremely fortuitous event for the entire Fan family.

However, while confronting Lu Xinwen, he himself was unable to speak out of fear. How could he dare speak of cooperation? He could only hopefully glance at him and respectfully bend over.

Without a change in expression, Lu Xinwen said, “You wish to serve by side, you don’t care about my notorious reputation?”

Fan Shui inwardly cursed, ‘So you also knew that your reputation is spread everywhere?’ Of course, he didn’t dare express such thoughts in any way. At the same time, he was quite concerned inwardly, wondering how Fan Vastsun would respond.
