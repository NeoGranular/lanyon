He’d maintained a powerful strength on his arms from beginning to end. It was as if a huge grinding machine had been slowly whittling away their Internal Energy.

This kind of feeling was indeed quite frightening. Zhuang Yuan and Xiao Yilin would have rather had a swift death like Xiao Yifan instead of dying such a slow and tiring death. However, as of now, their life and death was no longer in their control. It only followed Yiming’s baton, continuously spinning along with it.

It lasted until one of the two had completely exhausted himself, causing He Yiming to sober up.

This moment, Zhuang Yuan’s eyes no longer had the haughtiness, astonishment, fury, or resentment from before, and like Xiao Yilin, there was only confusion, and loss.

Under complete exhaustion, he could no longer preserve any emotion. Perhaps his only thought at this moment was to forget everything and just close his eyes.

The reason he could still survive was almost purely instinctive which was supported by a desire to live.
