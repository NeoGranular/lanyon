Yang Chen and Chu Heng’s grudge had existed for a long time, it was already a well known matter in the Pure Yang Palace. Only currently, everyone was in support of Yang Chen and there was almost nobody in support of Chu Heng. After all, colluding with outsiders to attack a fellow disciple was a crime which no sect, even the devil sect, would permit.

Therefore, Yang Chen going to look for Chu Heng to settle his grudges, was not any strange thing. The Palace Master had already said that, after the sect executed it’s punishment, the matter between Yang Chen and Chu Heng was private. Currently, as the Law Enforcement Hall could not find Chu Heng’s whereabouts, nobody could say anything about Yang Chen going to look for him by himself.

Gao Yue had wanted to say something, but looking at Wang Yong’s expression, she didn’t open her mouth and only kept looking at Yang Chen with a complicated expressions. Her gaze contained traces of worry for Yang Chen.
