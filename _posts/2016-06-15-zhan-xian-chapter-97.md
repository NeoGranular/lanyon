Third grade foundation stage pills, even if these cultivators had swelled like elm tree or were dregs, as long as they could reach the peak qi layer and take the third grade foundation stage pill, they would surely be able to reach the foundation stage.

Shen Da and the other three had already reached sixth qi layer in these ten years with the occasional guidance of Yang Chen. From the third qi layer to sixth qi layer, could be considered as a good cultivation speed. Possibly their comprehension was weak previously, or maybe their luck was not that good and they couldn’t keep up with people who had passed on or maybe they didn’t even try their hardest, and had thus sank down to become servants.

During these ten years, Yang Chen had also observed these four with the help of other people. They were already unswerving towards Yang Chen, even when Chu Heng had done his utmost to deal with Yang Chen, they still hadn’t betrayed him. Therefore, this was their deserved reward.
