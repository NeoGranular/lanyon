After having a casual meal, Yuan Lixuan took a few turns and led them to a spacious street.

On this big street, there weren’t much people. The decorations of the shops at the sides of the street were exceedingly plain and simple. However, there was a baselessly profound atmosphere pervading the street.

“What is this place?” He Yitian astoundedly asked.

“This is the street of county town’s most reputed antique shops,” Yuan Lixuan proudly said, “Every antique here is at least five hundred years old. The good stuff in here is simply too vast to be countable. You can only slowly explore by yourself. If your luck is not good, you can only return with empty hands.  However, if your luck is good, striking rich overnight is also not uncommon.”

He Yiming faintly nodded. He wasn’t too fond of such things. However, He Yitian appeared to be somewhat interested.

With the introduction of Yuan Lixuan, they headed towards a store that reportedly had some good commodities.

He Yiming gently tugged and said, “Brother Yuan, does your family have a shop here?”

Yuan Lixuan’s face turned slightly red, “Unfortunately, our Yuan family doesn’t deal in antiques.”

He Yitian took out a gold ingot that was more than ten taels heavy and said, “Yiming, I’m going in to take a look. If you don’t want to come, you might as well roam on your own. We’ll meet here again two hours later.”
