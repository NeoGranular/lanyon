Hen Tong county town was a bustling city. Although it wasn’t as big as Fire Crow country’s Downwind city and it didn’t have a majestic city wall either, compared to Tai Cang county’s county town, it was uncountable folds more prosperous.

Since the night of the banquet, after the Yuan brothers completely ripped each other’s face apart, the relationship between their sides also dropped to the freezing point.

Yuan Zeyu didn’t hesitate in the slightest before ordering the banishment of the branch family from the Yuan family and regained the authority of the shops in the city as well.

At first, he believed that under these circumstances, Fan family would immediately act for Yuan Zewei. However, he hadn’t expected Fan family to not even budge for five days straight despite Yuan Zewei’s side leaving the manor and their whereabouts completely unknown.

This strange event instead made Yuan Zeyu overly suspicious.

However, He Yiming and Yitian, after staying in the Yuan Mansion for several days couldn’t help but begin to feel a little bored. They made a request to make a trip to the county town. Yuan Zeyu naturally had no objections regarding this request. On the contrary, he even made one of core members of the young generation accompany them.
