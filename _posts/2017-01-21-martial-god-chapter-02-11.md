“Temper bones, condense essence into Internal Energy, cultivate Internal Energy...this is Houtian.”

In the room, He Yiming’s slow, skeptical voice echoed.

The book lay opened in his hands as he read by the torch flame on the wall. He discovered that this was the not the complete book, but a major part of it.

However, it was still the most detailed among all the books he’d ever seen.

Other than the author’s personal experience, for the most part, it explained the essentials to break through at every layer below the tenth. The author of this had evidently not experienced the Xiantian realm for himself, and thus, it didn’t help He Yiming at all.
