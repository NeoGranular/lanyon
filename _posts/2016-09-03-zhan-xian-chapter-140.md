The people watching in the surroundings didn’t know, even Gao Yue and Shi ShanShan, who were standing close to it didn’t know, whom Li Yunyu had shouted these words to.

Yang Chen was currently in the winning position, his slash was furthermore very bold and powerful. But Li QingChen had also unleashed a high level armour, and was moreover holding a silver ball, which was some kind of unknown magic weapon, supposedly his means to strike back. So even among them, they were unable to determine whom these words were said to.

But Guan Yueying knew that Li Yunyu’s shout was meant for Yang Chen. The might of that one slash, although other people couldn’t see it, she and Li Yunyu, the two YuanYing stage experts were able of determining it properly.
