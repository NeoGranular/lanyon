“The disciples who have been instructed would have the final say?”

The Palace Master was startled, but immediately realized something and gently laughed:

“Right, right, indeed those disciples should have the final say!”

In matters of cultivation, the person who experienced it personally knew the best. Other people may sense if their cultivation was higher, but they wouldn’t know what kind of problems their cultivation had. Whatever method they used, it would not be better than the person’s own sensation.

It would not be unreasonable to say that the person himself would know if he had made some mistakes or not, but if his cultivation had been continuing smoothly, and his spirit power was stable, his spiritual awareness was rising stably, so what kind of problem could there be?
