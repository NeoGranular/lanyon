Because of his current cultivation realm, although Yang Chen had found a suitable cultivation method for all attributes to cultivate after reaching the foundation stage, apart from his fire attributed cultivation, Yang Chen hadn’t reached the foundation stage in any other attribute, so he was not able to integrate these high grade cultivation methods with his Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets.

This had become Yang Chen’s biggest weakness. Because not all of the five phases of yin and yang had reached the foundation stage, he was unable to use a lot of things, including the Heavenly Stars Treasure Refining Secrets and the Earth Fiend Sacrificial Formation Secrets.

After becoming the disciple of his master, Yang Chen could see his master every day and every night, his long cherished wish to become the disciple of his master again had also come true, and he had also established the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard, so now increasing his cultivation was the most important matter.

Strictly speaking, the fire attribute of Yang Chen which had reached the Foundation Stage was only the fourth fire, because the Geocentric Flame had greatly increased the cultivation of Yang Chen’s fourth fire. In his previous life, Yang Chen hadn’t differentiated strictly between the Yin and Yang attribute during cultivation, but currently, because of the Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets, he had to divide them clearly.

In other words, including the Spirit Power with the third fire attribute, Yang Chen had nine attributes of Spirit Power which had to be upgraded through cultivation, in order to reach the Foundation Stage.

After reaching the Foundation Stage at the villa of Elder Wu, Yang Chen had basically spent all of the time with consolidating the Foundation Stage because of the fear that Elder Wu might discover the Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets, so he basically didn’t cultivate. Even to the extent that after reaching the Foundation Stage to the time until the Heaven Seizing Pill was refined, the Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets basically hadn’t progressed even a single step. From the beginning to the end it had been halted at the ninth qi layer.

But Yang Chen knew that every attribute of his that reached the Foundation Stage would help in increasing the other attributes to a small extent. In other words, as long as one or two attributes of Spirit Power reached the Foundation Stage, then the remaining five phases of yin and yang would be able to reach the peak of the qi layer. Then at that time, as long as he refined enough Foundation Stage Pills for himself, reaching the Foundation Stage would not be a problem.

Currently the simplest way for Yang Chen was to increase his third fire attribute. Regardless of whether it was his experience or outside help, both were in his grasp. In his previous life, he was a fire attributed cultivator, and the Real Sun Fire was precisely of the third fire attribute, these two things added together would allow Yang Chen to quickly build the foundation of his third fire attribute.

Naturally, with Yang Chen’s current cultivation level, absorbing the Real Sun Fire was not possible. In his previous life, when Yang Chen was at the middle JieDan stage, he had received the chance to obtain the Real Sun Fire, but still he had just narrowly escaped with his life, almost visiting the yellow springs when absorbing it. But after absorbing it, his achievements were astonishing, not only was he able to reach the YuanYing stage, the Da Cheng stage and then ascend, but he was also able to reach the immortal world.

The Real Sun Fire was extremely precious, He LianYun had also obtained this flame by concocting pills for other people, but now all of his work had helped Yang Chen accomplish his aim. Although Yang Chen could not absorb the flame right then, the Profound Spirit Furnace could. So long as it absorbed the flame successfully, the grade of the Profound Spirit Furnace would increase dramatically.

After one month he stopped going to the Hidden Pavilion. During this time, after making sufficient preparations and informing his master and other friends, Yang Chen went into seclusion to absorb the Real Sun Fire.

Yang Chen took out the small lamp in which Elder Wu had sealed the Real Sun Fire from his Achievement Ring and placed it in front of him. Seeing it for the first time, nobody would believe that this small lamp, flickering like it would extinguish at any moment, actually contained the Real Sun Fire.

The process of absorbing it was similar to the Geocentric Flame, with some slight differences. After all, the Real Sun Fire was two grades higher than the Geocentric Flame and a fifth grade flame was a rare flame, even in the spiritual world. It’s might was enough to make both Yang Chen and Profound Spirit Furnace disappear without a trace, if Yang Chen was even a little inattentive during the refining.

Luckily, Yang Chen had possessed the Real Sun Fire in his previous life, so even in spiritual world no one would be more familiar with this flame than him. He used the Heavenly Stars Treasure Refining Secret to refine the Profound Spirit Furnace and then again used the Universal Treasure Raising Secrets for maintenance, only then did he slowly bring the Profound Spirit Furnace near that small trace of fire.

At the instant Yang Chen approached it, the controlled Profound Spirit Furnace extracted a hair sized flame essence of the Real Sun Fire from the small trace of fire. Compared to the time Yang Chen when absorbed the Geocentric Flame, this trace was even tinier, not even equal to one tenth of that time.

With just this one trace of flame, Yang Chen had a sensation as if the Profound Spirit Furnace was being surrounded by the fire on all sides and in a flash the temperature of the Profound Spirit Furnace increased so much, that nobody could touch it. The whole body of the Profound Spirit Furnace was fiercely burning, as if it could melt any moment.

This was the most dangerous time, if Yang Chen was not able to control the intensity of the flame at this moment, then the whole Profound Spirit Furnace could be destroyed. Yang Chen had already prepared the materials for this, taking out a properly prepared Profound Cyan Crystal Gold, he carefully placed it into the Profound Spirit Furnace.

Indeed, Yang Chen had already planned to use the opportunity when the Real Sun Fire was being absorbed to refine the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold and increase the quality of the Profound Spirit Furnace. The Profound Cyan Crystal Gold was not something that could be refined by an ordinary flame, even if it was the Real Sun Fire, if it was not controlled by someone, it would require a sufficient temperature to be able to refine it. Currently the majority of the heat of the hair sized flame would be absorbed by the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold, allowing the Profound Spirit Furnace to take advantage and absorb it.  

Previously Yang Chen didn’t have any methods to refine this such a large Profound Cyan Crystal Gold. Although the Geocentric Flame burned fiercely, it could only be used to refine herbs and earth attributed objects and basically had no effect on such a high grade Profound Cyan Crystal Gold.  

As expected, due to the effects of such a method, the temperature of the Profound Spirit Furnace no longer rose, it even started to cool down. On the contrary, some transformations began to happen in the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold chest kept inside of the Profound Spirit Furnace.

Those traces of rust on the outer surface began to be peeled off little by little. All of those were the impurities of the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold, which the mountain god was not able to purify, so they remained on the chest in the form of corrosion. Currently these impurities began to slowly separate under the fiercely burning Real Sun Fire.  

After that hair sized trace was absorbed by the Profound Spirit Furnace, Yang Chen controlled the Profound Spirit Furnace once more to extract another trace, continuing the cycle in this way.

The Profound Spirit Furnace continued to absorb more and more traces of the flame, and the chest made out of Profound Cyan Crystal Gold also started to constantly change color. After the impurities were separated, the chest slowly turned red, with an alarming temperature, but there was no change in its shape. This property of the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold was very suitable to make pill concocting furnaces and fire attributed flying swords, so using it on the Profound Spirit Furnace just happened to be suitable.

Naturally, such a large piece, Yang Chen would not be able to use it completely, but as long as he could use one tenth of it, it would be sufficient to allow the Profound Spirit Furnace to completely transform.

During this cycle, the small flame trace in the lamp kept on becoming smaller and smaller and finally extinguished completely.

For every hair sized trace of the flame he absorbed, the third fire Spirit Power within his body was refined even more. The flame of the Real Sun Fire was very fierce, so Yang Chen did not dare to absorb it into his body at the moment, but this did not stop Yang Chen from taking his own Spirit Power into the Real Sun Flame and refining it by burning and then pulling it into his body again.

At least ninety percent of the Spirit Power was used up in the refining by burning from the Real Sun Fire, but that leftover trace was more pure by many times. During the absorption of every hair sized trace, Yang Chen lost nine tenth of his third fire Spirit Power. Fortunately the Spirit Power of the Di Mai was quite strong and Yang Chen also had sufficient Profound Yang Fruits for replenishment, so he could quickly restore his Spirit Power before every absorption.

For every trace of flame he extracted, the Spirit Power would have to undergo this sort of refining, so Yang Chen’s third fire Spirit Power was being hammered into shape by the Real Sun Fire. After the Spirit Power was recovered, it was quickly consumed by the fire, leaving only little bit behind. Soon after that it would be restored again and then refined once more.

The Spirit Power left behind after being burned by the Real Sun Fire was increasing, and this Spirit Power was even more pure than the the Spirit Power after being refined by the Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets. The higher the quality of the Spirit Power, the higher the cultivation of the third fire Spirit Power.

When half of the Spirit Power remained after burning from the Real Sun Fire, it had finally reached the critical point. For Yang Chen, there was basically no comprehension needed for cultivation, as long as he could accumulate a sufficient amount of Spirit Power, he could easily break through.

Within the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard, the Spirit Power of the Di Mai was acting as if it was being strongly attracted by something, frantically converging at the small room where Yang Chen was in seclusion. It was enough to interrupt the cultivation of all the YuanYing stage experts who were cultivating, using the Spirit Power of the Di Mai. All of the Spirit Power was rushing forth to enter Yang Chen’s body.

The people of the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard all noticed this anomaly, this kind of situation was not strange to anyone, it was clear that someone was trying to link the energy of heaven and earth, while trying to build their foundation. After a moment, everything would return to normal.

But nobody knew why this was happening. Hadn’t Yang Chen already built his foundation? So how could this situation of heaven and earth being joined, come about? After the foundation stage, the body would automatically attract the Spirit Power of heaven and earth, so could it be that Yang Chen had abolished his cultivation and was building his foundation all the way again?

Although everyone was suspicious, nobody became impatient and rushed to enter and disturb Yang Chen. Who didn’t know the biggest taboo of seclusion? Everyone was scared that someone would suddenly break in and disturb them. Moreover, this situation was not anything bad, it could also mean that Yang Chen had made some breakthrough and therefore had triggered this kind of situation.

Due to the third fire Spirit Power building a foundation, Yang Chen’s cultivation had been upgraded by one grade. Previously, when he was at Elder Wu’s villa, he had built his foundation with the support of the Geocentric Flame and the medicinal power of the blue-green zoysia, but currently was not the same: this time, the third fire Spirit Power was refined by crazily being burnt by the Real Sun Fire and only then did it reach the foundation stage. The Spirit Power of third fire was now many times more pure compared to the other types of Spirit Power, so at once it occupied the top place within the five phases of yin and yang.

The other phases of the five phases of yin and yang crazily absorbed the Spirit Power of the Di Mai during the process of linking the Heaven and Earth. Within a brief moment, they had absorbed enough Spirit Power, so the Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets had been upgraded by one layer and attained the tenth layer, the peak of the qi layer.

Within his spirit sea, the color of the long blood river grew even deeper. The space surrounding it had expanded even more during this process of building the foundation, forcibly increasing by at least fifty percent. Currently it could compare to around half of the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard.

Perhaps because only the fire attributed Spirit Power had reached the foundation stage, the spirit sea was divided into layers. At the top was an image of the sun, burning fiercely and underneath that blood river was another dark red colored flame river, clearly reflecting the Real Sun Fire and the Geocentric Flame.

In his previous life, although Yang Chen possessed the Real Sun Fire, it was still not reflected in his spirit sea, but currently, although he hadn’t absorbed the Real Sun Fire, it had already left that imprint within his spirit sea. Apart from the long river, capable of being used as killing intent, he was still unable to tell what kind of uses it had.

The process of absorbing the Real Sun Fire into the Profound Spirit Furnace was still not complete, so Yang Chen did not dare to casually stop it in the least. After he reached the foundation stage, the third fire Spirit Power was even more abundant. The hair sized flame extracted every time had also turned thread sized, with its speed becoming almost ten fold.

When the flame on the lamp had completely disappeared, a golden coloured ball of Real Sun Fire appeared within the Profound Spirit Furnace. This golden ball of Real Sun Fire was in a different direction from the Geocentric Flame, without the slightest bit of interfering with each other, but with just a thought, Yang Chen could move them like his arms and legs.

Within the Profound Spirit Furnace, the intact Real Sun Fire was crazily burning the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold. The Profound Cyan Crystal Gold chest, which wasn’t affected in the slightest during previous few months, had already changed shape, changing into an object as flexible as dough.

The Profound Spirit Furnace was already linked with Yang Chen’s thoughts and with just a thought, the melted Profound Cyan Crystal Gold began to slowly divide into two parts. The bigger part quickly flew out of the Profound Spirit Furnace and began to cool, while the remaining, smaller part, began to melt even more, fusing with the Profound Spirit Furnace bit by bit.

The Spiritual Awareness offered by his formidable spirit sea, was sufficient to allow Yang Chen to penetrate any region within the furnace. Those regions which were not stable because of the low levelled materials were replaced, bit by bit, by the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold and afterwards began to separate under the burning of the Real Sun Fire.

By then, the absorbed Real Sun Fire was in fact the whole of the flame, which had split up to purify the metal box and refine the profound spirit furnace in one process. This lead to the current situation, where only the last step was remaining.

When the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold had completely fused with the Profound Spirit Furnace, the color of the Profound Spirit Furnace had changed to the cyan color of the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold. If looked from far away, the pill furnace did not look as if made of metal, and more like it had turned into porcelain. Yan Chen immediately used the Heavenly Stars Treasure Refining Secrets and the Earth Fiend Sacrificial Formation Secrets to refine it and only then was the refining of the Profound Spirit Furnace complete.

The Real Sun Fire, together with the Profound Cyan Crystal Gold, one was a fifth grade flame, one was the best quality material in the mortal world. Even if only one was used, it would be able to change the Profound Spirit Furnace entirely, but currently, under the formidable power of both, it had changed multiple times. Currently the Profound Spirit Furnace was not inferior to the violet coloured furnace used by Deng Yi.  

“Just right, this kind of Profound Spirit Furnace should be able to refine third grade pills!”

Yang Chen looked at the pill furnace on his hand in satisfaction and faintly smiled.

“Third grade foundation stage pills should be sufficient to make all of the remaining Spirit Power reach the foundation stage!”
