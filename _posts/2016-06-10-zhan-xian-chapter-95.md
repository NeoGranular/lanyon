Because of his current cultivation realm, although Yang Chen had found a suitable cultivation method for all attributes to cultivate after reaching the foundation stage, apart from his fire attributed cultivation, Yang Chen hadn’t reached the foundation stage in any other attribute, so he was not able to integrate these high grade cultivation methods with his Five Phases of Yin and Yang secrets.

This had become Yang Chen’s biggest weakness. Because not all of the five phases of yin and yang had reached the foundation stage, he was unable to use a lot of things, including the Heavenly Stars Treasure Refining Secrets and the Earth Fiend Sacrificial Formation Secrets.

After becoming the disciple of his master, Yang Chen could see his master every day and night, his long cherished wish to become the disciple of his master again had also come true, and he had also established the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard, so now increasing his cultivation was the most important matter.
