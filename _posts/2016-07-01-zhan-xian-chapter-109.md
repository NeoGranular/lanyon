For the Meadow Viper, this was not a difficult task, it had already transformed its body to the size of a young Meadow Viper and concealed its entire breath. It could crawl to the inside, but nobody was able to discover him. Previously when Yang Chen had been silently surrounded by the Meadow Viper, he also wasn’t able to discover it.

After entering the small town, Yang Chen immediately found a place to stay and started training in it. He currently already knew the arrangements of the enemy, so what was left was to think about a way to handle it.

“Tell me, which is better, should we go and fight over the thing the enemy has guarded for several years, or is it better to steal it secretly?”

Sitting upright, Yang Chen consulted the Sand Scorpion crawling over his body. He had never treated these YuanYing stage demon beasts as idiots, his current enquiry was also honest and sincere.
