Since the time Yang Chen had returned, he had been engrossed in refining the second wood flying sword, but now that the flying sword had been completed, Yang Chen could finally mention his request to his master. At the time of the bet with Cheng Wencai, Gao Yue had promised one request to Yang Chen. When Yang Chen had killed Lin Chengh, he hadnâ€™t raised that request, but instead had delayed the matter, afraid that she would not accept his request.  

Now a few months had already passed after the event, so Yang Chen reckoned that his master already should have a rough idea of what he wanted to ask of her, so if he spoke at this time, there would not be too many negative consequences.

In this life, Yang Chen wanted to cherish Gao Yue in every possible way. He was unable to tolerate even a single wrongdoing to her. As for the matter of the water attributed cultivation method, he wanted to introduce her to this direction willingly rather than forcing her.
