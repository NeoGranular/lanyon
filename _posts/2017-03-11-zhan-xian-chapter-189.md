Earlier because of the great calamity of devil cultivation, nearly all big sects were in chaos and didn’t have the time to speak about the matter of Yang Chen’s dao companion. Afterwards he was a little under the pressure from his reputation being tarnished by He Lianyun and that clan, so this matter was pushed to the back of his head.

Originally the Palace Master Zhong Jiao had intended for this matter to be resolved successfully on its own, but since Yang Chen himself had taken the initiative to rise it, Palace Master had no option other to clear where he stood.

“Green Jade Immortal Islands’ Fairy Shi!”

Palace Master Zhong Jiao forced a bitter smile. Looking at Yang Chen, he suddenly asked:

“Regarding cultivation talents, regarding perception, regarding beauty, regarding cultivation, Fairy Shi apparently had it all! If you form a sturdy bond with Fairy Shi by becoming her dao companion, it will also form a good relationship between Green Jade Immortal Islands and my Pure Yang Palace, are you really against it?”
