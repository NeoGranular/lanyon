That big man gloomily looked at Yuan Earnest. Since he’d been the first to speak among their group, he naturally attracted everybody’s attention.

However, his reaction was contrary to what they had expected. Confronting thirty plus horse Red Cloth bandits, he’d not shown the slightest bit of panic. On the contrary, the corner of his eyes contained a trace of disdain.

That Red Clothed bandit had also seen the ways of world. He naturally didn’t make any error in discerning it. His brows twisted as the group of people before him turned even more unfathomable.

“Boss Liao, why exchange meaningless words with them. These horses are quite good. Let's keep them all. Leader will certainly have a reward for us.”
