“Where should we go?” small girl asked.

“Don’t know, we will live somehow.” Both legs of the small boy were completely stuck  inside the heavy snow. He was moving, but with great difficulty. With every step he took forward, a metal colliding sound was produced. Both of his legs and feet were tightly bounded together by an iron chain. Snowflakes were rolling on his face like knives. He didn’t dodge them, there was nowhere to dodge. He was lifting his body up in such a way. It’s been a quite a while since he had blinked his eyes. Dragging the chains, carrying the small girl, he kept on going forward.

“I am a little cold.” The small girl said.

“Me too. We are cold together.” small boy replied.

“Okay!” Small girl agreed.

Behind two of them, deep footprints were engraved inside the boundless white snow with a faintly visible red colour.

At the end of the footprints, there wasn’t snow inside, there was blood.

Dyed red with fresh blood. Every person who toppled over was watching with an incredulous face, as if he was looking at something inconceivably frightening.

Huge snowfall was mournfully covering all of this.
