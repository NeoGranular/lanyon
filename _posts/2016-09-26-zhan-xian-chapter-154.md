Hao Yi Manor was very large. It had an area of several hundred mu and had servants protecting the courtyards and so on. They numbered almost a thousand people. Suddenly at midnight at a distance of almost ten miles from the Hao Yi Manor, the figures of a few people appeared.

“Senior, can you bind this entire building?”

Yang Chen could see a spell formation protecting Hao Yi Manor and asked the old tree demon at his side.

“This is just a trifling area of a few hundred mu, this old man’s roots can cover even bigger manors.”

The old tree demon looked like an old man at this moment, his beard was very long and he was wearing a type of mottled clothes. His appearance exactly resembled an old man in dire straits.
