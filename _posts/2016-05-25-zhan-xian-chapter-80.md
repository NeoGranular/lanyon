It had to be said that the pill concocting of Deng Yi, Zhu Peng and He LianYun was not bad, at least in their control of heat, they had already achieved the peak, refining these several tens of thousands of catties of ingredients into a lump the size of a human head, without even a trace of burning. The reason why only this black colored lump was left, was because they had never been able to condense the pill from the start.

Currently the black lump was still burning before everyone’s eyes, but apart from Yang Chen, nobody gave it even a single glance. Everyone was immersed in their dejection, because their meticulous efforts had gone in vain and for some time nobody opened their mouth, the whole place was filled with a lifeless atmosphere.

Yang Chen walked a few steps to the pill concocting furnace, lowered his head and started examining the black colored dregs delicately. This action immediately attracted everyone’s attention, everyone’s gazes concentrated on him in a flash.
