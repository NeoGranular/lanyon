The peak foundation stage disciple, who was almost killed under the foot of the earth attributed beast and was at his last breath, wasn’t able to hide anything when faced with Yang Chen’s soul stunning technique. Yang Chen didn’t even need to use his killing intent, just asking what he needed to know was enough.

The Greatest Heaven Sect had several disciples train here, most of them were wood and earth attributed, but this was not very strange as most of the cultivators who came here were wood or earth attributed. Also, since these disciples had been sent to train here, the Greatest Heaven Sect also had a few JieDan stage experts keeping watch and provide support, which was also completely logical, it was also said that there was also a YuanYing stage expert among these overseers.

On the front, everything seemed normal, but Yang Chen knew about the most important matter here. The matter related to the great spell, most likely these low level disciples didn’t know anything.
