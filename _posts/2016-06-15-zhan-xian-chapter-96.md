The Profound Spirit Furnace had increased by several grades, allowing Yang Chen to have some confidence in being able to refine low level pills of the third grade. Most of all, as the Profound Spirit Furnace had absorbed the Real Sun Fire and his third fire and fourth fire spirit power had reached the foundation stage, refining elixirs such as the foundation stage pills, which could be refined with a cultivation of the foundation stage or lower, he had complete certainty.

But currently Yang Chen would absolutely not refine ordinary foundation stage pills. It had to be known that currently, the Profound Yang Fruits Yang Chen had were all a thousand years old and the maturity of the other ingredients would also astonish people. If he used this kind of ingredients to refine common foundation stage pills, then wouldn’t it seem like Yang Chen’s methods were a bit low levelled?

Previously, third grade foundation stage pills were sufficient to satisfy Yang Chen’s current needs. As long as he had the ingredients, it would be able to allow the attribute which Yang Chen focused on to reach the foundation stage. But currently Yang Chen had obtained the Penglai Divine Wood, so he had an even more outrageous thought.
