Before Yang Chen entered seclusion, he was called in by Palace master Zhong Jiao. The reason for calling him this time was none other than Yang Chen’s four servants reaching foundation stage. 

Among the inner disciples of Pure Yang Palace, how many were servants? It was not like servants who had the benefit of a long cultivation period and good guidance from their masters could not reach foundation stage successfully, but, these kind of servants are very rare. Moreover those who could reach foundation stage within a short twenty years with the inferior aptitudes of servants belonged to Yang Chen alone.

This point had already clearly illustrated Yang Chen’s exceptional guiding abilities. Guiding a disciple with a good aptitude to reach foundation stage was very easy, but guiding a servant who had an inferior aptitude to reach foundation stage was not something many could do.
