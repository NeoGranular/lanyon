After integrating the two Xiantian battle skills on the mountain peak, He Yiming returned back to the Yuan manor and calmly waited.

Inexplicably, he’d a feeling that Lu Xinwen would certainly come looking for him. 

Today, in the morning, he was silently conducting a breathing exercise in his room. Occasionally, his body glowed with a peculiar luster. This was a method by which he was tempering the body’s acupoints by the means of heavily absorbing in Xiantian True Qi. Although the efficiency of such a method was not high, it constantly stimulated the acupoints and allowed those acupoints which didn’t receive the tempering of five-phases techniques to slowly strengthen.

He Yiming, who was immersed in training, obviously didn’t know that one wouldn’t be able to interact with all acupoints immediately after stepping into Xiantian realm. Moreover, to think of a method of tempering them, although he wasn’t the first to do so, he still belonged to exceptionally rare existences.

In reality though, this matter had an extraordinary connection with his special body. 

Suddenly, from outside the manor, a powerful gale blew inside.
