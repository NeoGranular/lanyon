Within the sky, Guan Yueying did not have to face any attack from formidable sea beasts as, first, they would be unable to catch up with Guan Yueying’s speed, and second, attacks from the water could not reach Guan Yueying within the sky, so throughout the entire journey she hadn’t received any attacks from sea beasts.
