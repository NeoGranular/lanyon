Everyone was travelling within Yang Chen’s Flying Shuttle, flying very quickly. From the Devil Flame Valley to the edge of the Greater Mountains and then rushing from the edge of the Greater Mountains to the Pure Yang Palace, Yang Chen only needed a fortnight’s time.

The speed of the Flying Shuttle was very quick, which even startled Scarface and that old tree demon. Despite being amazed, that Cassia Tree Demon didn’t let any surprise appear on his face, but Scarface wasn’t the same.

What a fast Flying Shuttle Yang Chen possessed! If at that time Gao Yue had it, then Scarface and his people would not be able to catch her. Scarface really couldn’t imagine how big the strength of the Pure Yang Palace was.
