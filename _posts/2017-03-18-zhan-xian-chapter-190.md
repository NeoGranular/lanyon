Once these words left the mouth of black tiger, immediately the few experts of the Beast Taming Sect present on the scene were stunned. For several years, they had tried to find the reason of the problem, but they hadn’t been able to find it, but no one among them had anticipated that the black tiger himself knew the root of the problem.

However, what they didn’t understand was why hadn’t the black tiger informed them even after knowing the cause of his constituent spirit dissipation. Perhaps, because the black tiger knew that their cultivation was not sufficient and thus can’t help in solving the problem.

But, if this was true and the black tiger had tried to conceal his illness, then why did it told Yang Chen whom it was seeing first time that it had sustained internal injuries, could it be that it already knew that Yang Chen can cure its unmentionable illness?
