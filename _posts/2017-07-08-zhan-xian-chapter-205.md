Hearing Yang Chen’s words, Shi Shanshan couldn’t help but curiously ask:

“What kind of spirit beast is so easy to breed? Is it possible for me to take a look?”

Since the two people were publicly acknowledged to be dao companion, so naturally will not call each other as senior apprentice brother or senior apprentice sister or fellow daoist, just addressed each other informally.

Yang Chen also sensed that travelling without speaking is too difficult, Cold Plum Fairy Shi rarely took the initiative to speak, so Yang Chen also didn’t intend to brush her away and directly took out Heavenly Roar from Medicine Garden and released him within the Flying Shuttle.
