Anyone while mentioning Godou's slogan of surpassing the four major institutes, when he'd just established the Zhai Feng, would mention it as a joke. This included Zhai Feng's teachers, students, even the currently focussed Xi Fan and Mo Lin.

However, Chu Ming hadn't done so. Her voice was extremely tranquil and contained no ridicule as she mentioned this slogan, just as if she'd merely stated a fact. A little bit of regret in her voice was not because of 'surpassing the four institutes', but because Godou's target had become Zhi Ling region's Grand Soul Convention.
