With a gloomy face and an anxious heart, He Yiming walked out of the underground training room.

Ever since his fortuitous encounter in the lake, this was the first time he’d felt such indecisiveness and loss.

At this moment, that askew disdainful gaze and that extreme confidence seemed to have completely disappeared, and the future seemed to be indistinct and despairing.
