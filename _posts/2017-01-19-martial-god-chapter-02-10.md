His legs stood firm as his hands formed multiple, random Hidden Needle Imprints.

In comparison to Prostrate Imprint, since Hidden Needle Imprint relied on differently attributed Internal Energy, its seals were much more complex. In Houtian realm, one would probably not find another individual who could grasp this technique other than He Yiming, the creator of this technique himself.

As the seals formed, the Internal Energy in his meridians suddenly surged.

Strangely, the Internal Energy circulating inside his body didn’t belong to a certain type of his four primary techniques. Instead, it began with the metal-type Primordial Energy, and following the sequence of the five-phases, ended at the Blaze technique.

Under this constant transformation, the shape of the imprints formed by his hands also changed. However, regardless of how it changed, it still emanated a feeling like that of a needle hidden in a ball of silk floss. It wasn’t a stable and resolute feeling like that of a mountain which Prostrate Imprint emanated, but a strange, gentle one.
