This master of this territory was a Sand Scorpion, which had a cultivation similar to Meadow Viper and was at the YuanYing stage, the difference in their strengths was not very large. Hearing the Meadow Viper provoke the Sand Scorpion like this, Yang Chen found it very ridiculous.

Since the body of the Meadow Viper had become smaller, Yang Chen could take it along on his flying sword and travel faster. Throughout the whole journey, the Meadow Viper kept on with its arrogant provocations, as if fearing that the Sand Scorpion would not know that it had come. This kind of unbridled provocation made Yang Chen wish to stop the Meadow Viper by force.

After two hours, Yang Chen was flying on his flying sword, when he suddenly sensed a berserk pressure, crazily rushing towards his location. It didnâ€™t need an introduction, this could only be the Sand Scorpion, infuriated by the Meadow Viper, it rushed over to compare its strength with the Meadow Viper. As a response, Yang Chen immediately stopped his flying sword and landed on the ground.
