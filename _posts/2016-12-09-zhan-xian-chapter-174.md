Elder Wu’s strength had already reached the realm required for ascension a long time ago, but because of some unfinished business, his ascension was delayed. Just recently, he had passed the Yin Fire tribulation with his formidable cultivation. So his time of ascension had finally come.

When a YuanYing stage expert rose to the Da Cheng stage, he could trigger the fluctuations in spirit power within several hundred miles, as long as one was a cultivator, one could sense it. And when a Da Cheng stage expert ascended, the anomaly could be sensed even more clearly.

Those who had lived long enough to experience someone ascending naturally knew what was happening and those who hadn’t gone through the experience naturally didn’t know what the matter was.
