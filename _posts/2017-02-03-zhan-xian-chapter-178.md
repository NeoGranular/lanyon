Gao Yue was completely unable to figure out why Yang Chen had shown such an extreme reaction. This was the second time such a scene was happening, first time when Yang Chen had formally become her disciple. 

At first, Gao Yue thought that Yang Chen was extremely happy after receiving the flying sword, and thus, couldn’t control his emotions. However, she somehow noticed that he hadn’t even looked at the sword and just kept on holding the sword’s edge and shed tears. 

Fortunately, this situation didn’t last for long, only for some moments, before the pain from the cut by the sword woke him up. Facing Gao Yue with a face full of tears for the second put him in an awkward position. Finally, with her help, Yang Chen’s hand was cured.
