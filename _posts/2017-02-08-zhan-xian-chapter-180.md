When people were just sitting at home, matters were sent from heaven. This sentence certainly justified Yang Chen’s current condition. He was simply performing the duties of the Merit Transferring Disciple at the Nine Earth Manor, but there was always something weighing on his mind.

If it was just a matter of simple pill refining, Yang Chen wouldn’t care much about it. In fact, Shangguan Feng was currently substituting for Yang Chen to accept such requests, so naturally, for the time being, if disciples within the sect required some pills, they just had to follow the older rules and provide for their own materials and the price they had to pay was still just eighty percent of market rate.

However, when refining JieDan stage or higher level pills, Yang Chen had almost a hundred percent success rate. Only if someone asked for a second grade or a third grade pill, could there be some wear and tear. Many sect disciple were happy to gain Yang Chen’s help and, apart from receiving benefits, Yang Chen was also happy to let his Profound Spirit Furnace gain medicinal power.
