Palace Master didn't have any hesitation in front of Yang Chen and directly spoke what he was thinking. 

After suffering from the ambush last time, he had clearly realized that his cultivation was still weak. Although it was sufficient to manage a second rate sect, but as Pure Yang Palace has developed in recent times and considering its future development, he understood that his cultivation may not be able to keep up with it. Therefore, the matter of quickly increasing his cultivation was the most pressing issue for him presently. 

But, Palace Master was in the end the Palace Master, elders like Wang Yong would often enter seclusion but he couldn't do this so lightly as he still has to manage the Pure Yang Palace. So an efficient method to increase his cultivation has become all the more important.
