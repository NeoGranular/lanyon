Numerous YuanYing stage experts had their destined magic weapons destroyed and had sustained injuries. The other few YuanYing experts who didn’t have a destined magic weapon had also had their most powerful magic weapons destroyed by the Yin Fire, which had greatly lowered their strength.

But unfortunately, at this frightening time, in font of them was this frightening devil, Lin Chenghe, who had just passed the Yin Fire tribulation. The fact which made the situation even more hopeless was that two of their most powerful experts had been turned into his cultivation.

The only remaining expert was Green Jade Immortal Islands’ elder Min Huafeng as well as Pure Yang Palace’s Gui Shanyou. Obviously, elder Min Huafeng had become everyone’s last hope.
