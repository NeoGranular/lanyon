Yang Chen had reaped great harvests on this trip to Meng Qi mountain. But apart from the legendary herbs in the hidden valley, everything else was under Yang Chen's expectation.

The only headache Yang Chen had now was that he hadn't cleared everything with Shi Shanshan. In the future, this will become another troublesome matter.

However that hidden valley where he found the blood essence of Heavenly Roar Dog was also a reminder to him. The owner of Positive Yang Mountain's Medicine Garden, that is the owner of Yang Chen's current Medicine Garden in clean bottle had already ascended to Immortal World from Mortal World, three to four thousand years ago.
