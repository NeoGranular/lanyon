Why not? Yang Chen was naturally willing, but he still thought that there was some ulterior motive in this deal, so he could not help but warn him:

“That person is wearing an armor of Nanming Flame, so you must be careful, I want him alive.”

The Cassia Tree Demon immediately agreed and instructed at the same time:

“Tell that metal attributed woman to get out of the way!”
