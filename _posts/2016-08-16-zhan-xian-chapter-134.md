This time, Yang Chen had to invest a fully matured thousand year old ginseng, as well as some other, normal herbs. But, in return, he had established friendly relations with a Da Cheng stage expert, as well as obtaining a favor from her. Other people may not realize this now, but he had also obtained the gratitude of the Snow White Fairy of the future, and he had still received a blood phantom vine, which had sucked on a Da Cheng stage expert’s flesh until it was full.

It may be true that Hua Wanting passing her tribulation at that time was convenient for the upper echelons of the Clear Sky Sect, but Yang Chen also knew that, even if he hadn’t used that ginseng, people who could pass their tribulation would pass it and it would still have been convenient for these people, but it would not have been equal to him investing some price to gain that favor in any case.

Hua Wanting had promised Yang Chen a favour immediately after passing the tribulation because she had discovered that Yang Chen had used a thousand year ginseng for her. That, for her, who was weak in health, was the most suitable tonic. For this favour, she had to owe him.
