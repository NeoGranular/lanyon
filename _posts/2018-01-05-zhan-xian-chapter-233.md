The smile on Yang Chen’s face wasn’t hidden from everyone. All of them stopped the work in their hands and looked at Yang Chen. Senior apprentice sister Gongsun Ling even asked immediately:

“Something good happened? You seem pretty excited!”

“I discovered something good, however it is of no use for you all for the time being.”

Yang Chen didn’t give a clear explanation, but not to the point where he didn’t even say a word. He only gave them a general idea and then only smiled without saying anything.  

Since they can’t use it right now, everyone had completely lost interest. One cannot be overambitious in cultivation, taking firm steps one by one is the only genuine path, even if presently they obtain something of the level of Immortal World, that also isn’t of any use to them.

“Check your belongings, we return to the sect now!”

Seeing that everyone was ready to go, Yang Chen didn’t stay here for long. With one wave of his hand, everyone quickly collected their things and followed after him to return back to the main hall. 

Walking out was much more easier compared to entering. In any case, this cave dwelling was under Yang Chen’s complete control. With only some simple tricks, they easily came outside the cave dwelling.
