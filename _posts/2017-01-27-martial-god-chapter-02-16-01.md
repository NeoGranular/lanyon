After jumping down, the two long-armed racoons didn’t immediately attack. Rather, they slowly circled about. Perhaps they were teasing or trying to figure out how this bunch of humans had seen through their plan.

They were unlike humans. In addition to  a high wisdom, they also possessed exceedingly sharp perception. In their perception, the male holding the huge broadsword exuded a dangerous feeling. In comparison, although the rest were quite a lot in numbers, they didn’t amount too much.
