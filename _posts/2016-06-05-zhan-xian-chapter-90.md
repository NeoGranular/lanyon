As for sealing the six senses; strictly speaking Yang Chen had had only sealed five senses of this guy: ear, nose, eyes, tongue and body. All of these five senses had been sealed by Yang Chen, just leaving behind his consciousness. There was nobody in the mortal world who learned this technique, only Yang Chen, who was once a great principal golden immortal, knew this technique.

Leaving behind the consciousness meant that he could still think and hadnâ€™t sunk into a coma. If he still had hope to escape, being conscious was the best thing for him, but in this situation, where five of his senses had been sealed, it was more of a nightmare than luck.

He could not hear, could not see, could not smell, could not taste and even did not have any sensation of touch. Strictly speaking, after the consciousness was sealed, he would simply not have sense any kind of pain or comfort, this was just like his mind had been sent to a space without anything around him, where he could not even sense the passing of time clearly.
