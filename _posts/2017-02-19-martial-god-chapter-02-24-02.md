Those two guards immediately knelt and said, “To prince, just now a man suddenly appeared. We failed to notice him. Please allow us to atone for our crime.”

That man raised his head and glanced in the direction He Yiming had left. Actually, although he’d been in the palanquin, he was fully aware of everything that was happening outside. However, to his horror, even he’d no clue when He Yiming appeared before his troops.

If not for such a situation, this small matter wasn’t enough to make him make an appearance.

Although He Yiming was not using any technique, the length of his footsteps far exceeded that of an ordinary person. This moment he’d already arrived at the street’s corner. His figure flickered, suddenly disappearing from the vision of that man.

He hesitated a bit, turning his head and looking at the entrance of Xie Residence, and eventually forced himself to not deal with that person. For some reason, when he thought about dealing with that person, he felt a slight chill in his spine.
