These words of the Palace Master had already established the privileged position of the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard in the future. Apart from the people who Yang Chen had brought with him, if anyone wanted to enter the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard in the future, then he would first have to establish his merit before this permission was bestowed on him.

Naturally Yang Chen would not leave a room just for the Palace Master, Zhu Chen Tao would also require accommodations, so would the Law Enforcement Hall’s master, the Foreign Affair Hall’s master, and also the current Hall Master of the Fierce Yang Hall, since it was known as Second Fierce Yang Courtyard, there was no reason for the master of the Fierce Yang Hall not to come.

If these people kept an eye on them, the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard would have no big disturbances in the future. As for the Hall Master of the Luminous Moon Hall, wasn’t he in meditation pondering over his mistakes? So after he came out, Yang Chen could just pretend to have forgotten him, who would say anything? Would Liang Shao Ming really be so shameless as to run to a junior and demand things?
