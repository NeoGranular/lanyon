Ten thousand years was just Yang Chen’s initial estimate, but their real maturity may not just be limited to ten thousand years. He knew that it had already been over ten thousand years since Yang Erlang and Heavenly Roar Dog had ascended and these were left behind when Heavenly Roar Dog had ascended so it certainly could surpass that limit.

“Half belongs to both of us, you can choose first!”

Suddenly Yang Chen had some slight regret, if he had known earlier about this, he wouldn’t have led Shi Shanshan here, he had given a huge favour to Green Jade Immortal Islands for no reason. But he also wasn’t a cheap person who would hog everything to himself, so he generously extended his hand and indicated for Shi Shanshan to choose first.

Shi Shanshan was also a knowledgeable person, even though she didn’t specialize in pill concocting, she could still make out the maturity of these rare herbs. Greatly astonished, she didn’t expect to see Yang Chen being so generous and sighed.
