No one knew how regretful Guang Zhu was at the time of his death. If he had just known earlier that Yang Chen was gifting him an even higher grade flying sword, why would he bet his life to insist on the Bright Ray Sword?

Yang Chen mood worsened even more. His good mood was completely destroyed and he still had to deal with a series of matters, feeling extremely vexed.

Within the sect rules of the Pure Yang Palace, there was a rule that disciples of the same sect should not injure or kill each other, but there wasn’t anything written about self defense. Since Guang Zhu had come with seven people to take Yang Chen’s life, Yang Chen would certainly not let them remain alive.
