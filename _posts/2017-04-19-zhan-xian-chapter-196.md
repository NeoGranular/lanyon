Truly speaking, Yang Chen was certainly excited. He was controlling the Profound Spirit Furnace so he naturally knew that the Black Tiger Suppressing Elixir had been successfully refined. But this moment, he had spied an opportunity of good fortune so he immediately summoned the Nanming Fire to begin a second refining without hesitation.

If he wanted to increase the level of his pill concocting, than only relying on his experience of ten thousand years of refining some low grade elixirs was absolutely impossible. Only by charging forward to refine high grade elixirs would improve his pill concocting.

Since he wanted to establish himself as a pill concocting master in this life, and a high grade pill concocting master at that, Yang Chen couldnâ€™t let any opportunity slip by. And in front of him was one of the most optimum opportunity.
