Regardless of the circumstances, this was Yang Chen’s victory. Being a victor in a life and death duel against Greatest Heaven Sect’s Li QingChen was more important than anything else.

At least, it was like that according to Gao Yue. A life and death duel was not a joke, generally speaking, only one person would survive. Since Yang Chen had survived, the complications regarding it were not very troublesome, since he still had opportunities.

“Fairy Shi is quite beautiful, your luck with women is really good!”

After the tension had eased up, Gao Yue suddenly said this to Yang Chen with a smile which was not a smile. Only ridicule could clearly be seen in her eyes:

“She is furthermore a talented JieDan stage expert. After becoming dao companions with her, your cultivation will surely advance by leaps and bounds.”
