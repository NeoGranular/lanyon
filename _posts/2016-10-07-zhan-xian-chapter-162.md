Song Hang wanted to teach Yang Chen a lesson, but he ended up with a slap on his face. Those hall masters and the Palace Master, whom he had previously asked to punish Yang Chen, had instead become spectators for his own humiliation, moreover he could not offend them and neither did he dare to have any thoughts of attacking Yang Chen.  

The meeting was then disbanded, but the only one who left was Song Hang. None among the others left, waiting for Yang Chen to clarify that matter regarding the Da Cheng stage expert. Everyone could not help being curious. A Da Cheng stage expert was the target of every sect for roping in, how could it be so easy for Yang Chen?

Yang Chen would certainly not speak of this in the Nine Earth Manor, the group of elders this concerned the most were also not present, so Yang Chen did not say much and invited everyone to the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard, and even specifically asked for that group of elders to be requested over, so that everything could be cleared up.
