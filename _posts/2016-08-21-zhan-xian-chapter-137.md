Obtaining the Eighth Metal True Secrets was like a burden being removed from Yang Chen’s heart. His entire body was relaxed and happy.

Initially he had thought that he would not be able to obtain the Eighth Metal True Secrets from the Clear Sky Sect the first time. It had to be known that the libraries of the Clear Sky Sect contained information accumulated over countless years, something which a small sect absolutely could not compare to. Even the Hidden Pavilion in the Pure Yang Palace had a few million jade slips, how would the Clear Sky Sect have any less?

Who would have thought that, because of Mo Qian’s dirty tricks, he would be able to obtain these most unreasonable kinds of books which would allow him to obtain the Eighth Metal True Secrets the first time. Thinking about this made Yang Chen very happy.
