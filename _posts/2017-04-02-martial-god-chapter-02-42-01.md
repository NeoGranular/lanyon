True Qi- only the True Qi which lied above the ordinary martial dao could bring such an instantaneous destruction and completely disregard the defense of the treasured armguards, directly attacking Xiao Yifan’s internal body.

However, by the time this powerful cultivator of Internal Energy was able to react, he no longer had the opportunity to inform his other two brothers.

The moment his body seemingly lost all its weight and hit the ground, Zhuang Yuan and Xiao Yilin had already thrown themselves at He Yiming.

Their movements instantaneously attained their limits. The ninth layer expert and the tenth layer expert immediately took out their ultimate moves and struck at He Yiming without holding back in the slightest.

Zhuang Yuan’s whole body seemed to be sparking  faint, red-colored flames, indicating that his fire-type technique had been pushed to the extreme. The scorched air around his body carried an indistinct smell of sulphur, and even his clothes seemed as if they had begun to wither.

Even while confronting He Quanxin, he’d held himself back somewhat and hadn’t exerted his entire strength. However, at this moment, his mind screamed disaster. Although his opponent was merely an unremarkable youngster, under the pressure of the critical situation, the palm strike he unleashed was the most powerful move of his entire life.

Xiao Yilin didn’t have Zhuang Yuan’s strength, but his speed was even above that of the latter. The moment, He Yiming released Xiao Yifan’s arm, he’d already arrived behind He Yiming’s back. He waved his arm like lightning and struck at the vital section in the middle of He Yiming’s back.

The sleeves of his arm blew without wind and suddenly began to crack open. This was because he’d instantaneously poured all the Internal Energy he could concentrate into his golden armguards. After being amplified by the armguards, the Internal Energy could no longer be controlled by him, thereby tearing his sleeves and revealing two sparkling golden armguards.

As if a wolf howling, a swift sound of wind originated and directly entered He Yiming’s ears with a whoosh.  As long as one had some success in Internal Energy cultivation, he could easily feel the power of this move. Even if a tenth layer were to take this hit on his back, he would suffer the consequences.

Confronting the combined attack of the two carrying  all their might, He Yiming’s face still remained expressionless. At this moment, his consciousness was boundlessly elated, and his heart had no sentiment. His gaze on them was as if looking at an ant, devoid of emotion.
