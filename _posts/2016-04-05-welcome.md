## Welcome to the new Website!

We're proud to present this new website we have hastily thrown together in a few minutes to rake in that sweet, sweet ad revenue ( ;) ) and welcome everyone. We hope that your reading experience will improve thanks to the faster loading times, higher stability and simplicity of the website. If you have any issues, please feel free to contact us!

While we will show ads on this new site, we do not have any plans on using another ad network besides Google AdSense. So far, AdSense ads were always fairly unobnoxious, so it is our hope, that you can create an exception for our site in your adblocker. That'll help cover the time we spend translating and editing every day.

Thank You for your time.

Regards,

weletranslations
