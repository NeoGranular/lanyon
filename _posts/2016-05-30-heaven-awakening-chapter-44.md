The group of Zhai Feng had left. The students of Xia Feng were also pretty quick with their movements, soon after, they also began their journey in groups of three-five. Although last night’s affair didn’t have any relation to them, it still caused an air of tension around them. No one could say that they will not suffer a similar incident during the rest of their journey. Their sight-seeing mood, which had been present during the start of the uphill journey, was nowhere to be seen at this moment. Actually, the reason they hurried onto the road was in order to avoid the delegation of the City Master Mansion. The students who in ordinary times would love to get close to Wei Tianqi also didn’t wish to provoke trouble for themselves at this moment.
