In the forest, a nimble figure pushed through like a ghost.

Soon, this figure arrived in the deepest parts of the forest, where one would rarely find signs of humanity.

Apart from the veteran hunters who grew up in the forest itself, only the strong cultivators could ignore the dangers of this place.

This figure was precisely that of He Yiming, who had hurried over from the He manor.

Yesterday, when he couldn’t increase his Internal Energy at all, he immediately understood that his Internal Energy had once again attained the current layer’s peak.

He himself felt somewhat speechless about his cultivation speed.

Since he’d once again attained the peak, he first thought about finding a new cultivation technique, but then he suddenly gained a new insight about Hidden Needle Imprint.

After pondering for a bit, he immediately left for mountains to perform some tests and modifications.

Such insights were extremely rare, like a sudden inspiration- if he didn’t capitalize on it right now, he might never obtain another such opportunity in the future.
