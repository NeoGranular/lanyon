Du Qian subconsciously took those qiankun pouch and compass, not knowing what kind of matter had happened. Looking at Yang Chen, he asked him with some suspicion:

“This is?”

“This is my qiankun pouch.”

Yang Chen pointed towards that qiankun pouch and afterwards he pointed to the compass:

“This is a compass which can find the location of my qiankun pouch. This compass, there are a few more!”
<!--more-->

Saying this, he also took out those other compasses within the qiankun pouch. A series of exactly identical compasses were neatly placed on the ground. This made everyone feel as if a major affair was about to happen.

“When I was in the Immortal Falling Well, many people have chased me.”

Yang Chen narrated the events he had to go through, as if he was talking about something that had no relation to him.

“All of them had this kind of compass in their hands.”
