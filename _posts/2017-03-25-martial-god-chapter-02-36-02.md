Currently, his body was in a terrible shape. The hair on his head was curled all around and his face looked unsightly to the extreme, seeming as if he could fall at any moment.

Seeing him in such a terrible shape, the two leaders were obviously quite startled. Especially Guan Qing, since he knew where he’d come from. His expression changed as he sternly asked, “What happened? What about boss Liao?”

That man’s voice carried a hint of weeping as he said, “Leader, boss Liao died.”

Guan Qing’s face twitched but the expression in his eyes instead calmed down, “What happened? Tell me in detail.”

That man made a sound of agreement and immediately gave a quick account of his journey. He specifically mentioned the treasured horse that He Yiming was riding, saying that if not for this horse, they wouldn’t have acted.

After hearing, Guan Qing’s face darkened, “Four people….just four people wiped out all of you?”

“Leader, actually only two of them acted, “ That man ashamedly said, “But those two were too terrible, even leader Liao fell prey to their plot.”
