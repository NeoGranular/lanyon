In the beginning, when Yang Chen had taken out 64 middle grade spirit stones, Shangguan Feng and Wang Yuan had grown anxious. All of the 64 middle grade spirit stones were of the same size and every one among them had a weight of exactly ten catties. After exchanging them, they would be worth 64 000 catties low grade spirit stones.

Even if Shangguan Feng, Wang Yuan and Gongsun Ling added their wealth together, it would still not be more than this many spirit stones, but Yang Chen had taken them out without batting an eyelid. Not to mention anything else, just absorbing the Spirit Power of this many Spirit Stones could be compared to draining a low grade spirit vein, but surprisingly Yang Chen was using these things to arrange an unknown spell formation, simply extravagant.

Fortunately, everyone knew that Yang Chen was rich. Not to mention anything else, he had refined the Heaven Seizing Pill successfully, so surely Elder Wu would not treat Yang Chen unfairly, Spirit Stones were merely a small token after all. Everyone just thought that it was unfortunate that so many Spirit Stones were being used up.
