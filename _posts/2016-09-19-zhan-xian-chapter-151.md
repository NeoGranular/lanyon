Yang Chen flying ahead changed his speed many times, but no matter if he flew fast or slow, the people behind him certainly hadn’t intended to attack him near the Devil Flame Valley.

Discovering this, Yang Chen also began to move slowly. Naturally, just then nobody had discovered the small snake which had left Yang Chen’s body and entered the mountain woods.

Departing next was a small scorpion who also silently left and entered the thick jungle.

Soon after that, when he was approximately two hundred miles away from the Devil Flame Valley, Yang Chen sensed that the people chasing him had suddenly accelerated their speed.
