Sparrows flew across, white clouds, undergoing countless transformations, drifted in the blue sky. The green fields under the feet dyed the lands with shades of dark green and emerald green.

Several days had passed since they left Yuan family.

When they had arrived, it was close to Chinese new year. In order to rescue Yuan family, they rushed to the Yuan Residence, madly steering their horses. By the time they reached, seven of the horses had already given up.

Currently, it was already the third month in the spring. They had to spend two whole months in Yuan family to tidy up everything.

Upon returning, they didnâ€™t merely have eight horses and four people.

Fifty thousand gold taels gifted by Yuan family had been properly stacked into five big carriages. Every carriage was carrying a weight of about five hundred kilograms. Of course, the carriages were stacked with some random stuff on top to fool prying eyes.

In addition to all this, Yuan family even sent a combination of over hundred servants, attendants, and spongers as an escort squadron.

Of course, be it the members of He family, or they themselves, all were well aware that this so-called escorting was nothing more than an act. At most, they would be able to perform some odd jobs and keep watch.
