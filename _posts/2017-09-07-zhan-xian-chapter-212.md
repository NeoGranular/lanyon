Many years ago, there had been a debate in Pure Yang Palace about the ownership of treasures found by disciples. That time, it was decided that any treasure found by a disciple will belong to himself. 

This golden seal was Yang Chen's war spoils so naturally it belonged within Yang Chen's pouch. If others wants to snatch it forcefully, that was also impossible. The only method was to find some way to purchase or obtain it from Yang Chen according to his wishes. 

And the last two methods were more simple than forcefully snatching it from Yang Chen. After all, Yang Chen had a lot of treasures and he had fire attributed spirit root, so he wouldn't care much about a metal attributed tool refining material.
