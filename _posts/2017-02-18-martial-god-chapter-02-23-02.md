In a circle of hundred meter with him acting as the center, it seemed like nothing could escape his senses.

It was a mystical feeling. After absorbing the fire type energy from the heavens and earth, he seemed to have formed an exceedingly subtle connection with these energies. Through this fire energy, which was present throughout the heavens and earth, and through his interaction with this energy by absorbing and exuding it, he could miraculously make out an image of everything within a hundred meters around him.

Of course, this image was extremely distinct. Even in comparison to the image He Yiming could form after concentrating his attention on his ears, it wasn’t any better. However, in sensing the stationary objects and the atmosphere around his body, it seemed much more precise than the former.

He could feel that people dressed in the attire of attendants were flocking within his eighty meter range. These people seemed to be indistinctly standing by a line. They were looking at each other with traces of alarm evident on their faces. However, regardless of how much their numbers increased, they didn’t dare take a step forward.
