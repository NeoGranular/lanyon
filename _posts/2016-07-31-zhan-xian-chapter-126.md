Seeing the indifferent attitude of Yang Chen, Gao Yue had finally realized that the pressure of the Green Jade Immortal Islands didn’t work in front of Yang Chen. Disappointed, she gave up struggle and unwillingly asked:

“What do you want?”

“I have already said, if you don’t want anything, don’t provoke me!”

Yang Chen said, closing his eyes:

“From the beginning, you didn’t have the intention of killing me, that’s why I am giving you face, but by all means, you must not think that I am afraid to kill people!”

Speaking until here, Yang Chen stretched out his hand.

Whoosh!

The flying sword which had been pointed between her eyebrows suddenly disappeared. Immediately after that, Guan Yueying discovered that the spirit power in her body was no longer restricted and she had turned into the omnipotent peak YuanYing stage expert again.
