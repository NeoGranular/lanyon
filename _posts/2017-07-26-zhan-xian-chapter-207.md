Yazi, Dragon King’s second son, with a body of dragon and head of a dog, upright and resolute in nature, excellent warrior, fond of war and would always be holding a sword in his mouth and use it to increase his strength.

Presently, Heavenly Roar still hadn’t aroused Yazi’s blood vessels, so although his head seemed to resemble a dog, his body still resembled that of a dog since he was very young, thus other people would only consider him as a little pup. Hence not being discovered by others was normal.

Yang Chen had countless links to Yazi, not to mention other things, even the chief demon blade used by him at the execution ground, that so called chief demon was precisely Yazi.  Normal people believe that engraving Yazi on a knife’s end and sword’s hilt would increase the strength of their weapons, making it formidable.
