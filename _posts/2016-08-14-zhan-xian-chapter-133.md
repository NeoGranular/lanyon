Although the outside was a complete mess, inside, Yang Chen was laughing slyly. The majority of the blood phantom vine had already been collected by him into the Achievement Ring and moreover, when putting them in the ring, he had already placed them into the medicine garden of the medicine bottle.

Although it could not survive in ordinary conditions, the master root was still wrapped within the flesh of elder Hua Wanting’s heart. This was a Da Cheng stage expert’s flesh and blood, which the blood phantom vine couldn’t absorb completely even in a hundred years, this was enough to allow the blood phantom vine to survive for a short duration.

While everyone was believing that the blood phantom vine had been destroyed with that qiankun pouch, in reality, the main portion was still with Yang Chen.
