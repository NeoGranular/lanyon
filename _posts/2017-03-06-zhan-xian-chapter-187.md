Su Mosheng hadn’t concealed his gaze from the start, Yang Chen and Gao Yue could see clearly, even Gongsun Ling also could see the passion within his eyes. However, Yang Chen and Gao Yue didn’t say much.  

Gongsun Ling’s natural talents were brilliant, even the whole Pure Yang Palace approved of it. Even many lower disciples wanted to get close to Gongsun Ling and had the intention of becoming dao companion with her, however Gongsun Ling never paid heed to such false intentions.

Clearly Su Mosheng had either made out Gongsun Ling’s talent in one glance or he already knew about her and was thinking of some plan.
