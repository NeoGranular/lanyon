In the vast expanse of mountain forest, a figure swept through the ground like a bird.

This person was actually carrying another person in his hand, seeming as if the latter didn’t weigh anything at all.

Eventually, while passing through a mountainous depression, the figure’s feet tumbled once before he stopped in place.

He then immediately sat down on the ground, as if all the strength in his body had been drained away.

“Senior granduncle.”

A cry of surprise sounded at his side. Fan Vastsun immediately stood up and supported the old man.
