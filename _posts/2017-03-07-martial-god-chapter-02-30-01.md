Auspicious snowfall foretold a prosperous upcoming year.

When the new year’s first heavy snow fluttered down from the sky, He manor was already filled with  cries of joys and laughter.

For every person in the manor, the new year held a different significance. The youth, with the addition of another year, matured. The old turned even older. However, the two old men in the He manor were nevertheless quite delighted. Their younger generation had already matured enough to replace them.

Their days of shielding the He manor from wind and rain had gradually come to an end.

And this was perhaps the most cherished wish of all the old men!

“New Year’s Skill Competition, officially begins….”
