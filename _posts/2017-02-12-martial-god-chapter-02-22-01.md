The furnace blazed, increasing the temperature of the room. However, Xie Zhien and the two attendants evidently seemed accustomed to it, not feeling troubled at all.

Xie Mingjin’s body was dripping with sweat. He’d already drunk two big jars of water but to no avail.

He Yiming, on the other hand, was attentively their every movement, as if committing all of their actions into his memory.

Actually, He Yiming’s emotions were quite aroused. Before opening the furnace, Xie Zhien had told him that to become a distinguished alchemist, one need to possess exceedingly high innate talent. This talent, in addition to a high comprehensibility of herbs, also referred to an imperative possession of fire and wood type of Internal Energy attributes.
