As many of you might have already guessed, I've to sadly announce the end of my translations for MG. It was a great and fun ride for me. There are several reasons which I can't tell, but I can tell you that there is certainly no hard feelings invloved . I'll conclude the series with the end of 'Horse Bandits' arc. You can find the next chapters on the site linked down below. I'll also be starting a new series named Sage Ruler there.
