After enduring the suppression for so long, when the pressure on them suddenly disappeared, the two spiritual beasts were naturally overjoyed. Moreover, enduring for so long had also thoroughly ignited their fury. As soon as the pressure was lifted, they issued  furious roars and immediately wanted to tear apart the human who was the cause of their suppression.
