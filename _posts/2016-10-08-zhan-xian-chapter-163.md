Because there was absolutely no other opportunity, Lin Yunfeng fought for his face one last time, but other than feeling vexed, he didn’t feel anything.

The old tree demon was addressed as ‘senior’ by the group of people headed by the Palace Master. That old man, whether in terms of age or cultivation, was their senior.

Finally, after the consultation between these few people, the Palace Master, acting as a master receiving disciples, accepted the old tree demon into the Pure Yang Palace and the old tree demon became one of the few top-most cultivators in the Pure Yang Palace. Simultaneously, he also became the hall master of the Eccentrics Hall.
