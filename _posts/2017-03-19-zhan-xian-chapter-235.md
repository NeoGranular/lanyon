MeiQing Mountain market wasn’t restricted for outsiders or rogue cultivators, there someone keep a constant watch over there was ordinary. But this group of silkpants who had no worries in their lives, waiting there for him for a long time, was certainly not ordinary. 
 
Unless someone had gathered them together using some excuse like challenging Yang Chen for Fairy Shi. Moreover, that person had also used a common topic to push all the hatred on Yang Chen. 
 
That first person was clearly incited by someone. Given the nature of these silkpants, face was the most important thing for them. After Yang Chen had conceded defeat, they had also gained face, so at least most of them wouldn’t think of attacking him. But that person not only argued with him, he even took the initiative to attack Yang Chen. Clearly he wanted to coerce everyone into attacking and had hoped that Yang Chen would be killed in the confusion, thus creating trouble for Pure Yang Palace.
