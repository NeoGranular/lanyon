Bang!

Yang Chenâ€™s words immediately gave rise to a lot of comments. Unexpectedly, such an important recipe could also be exchanged.

As for Yang Chen saying, he could refine it. That was also not anything strange. Yang Chen was a pill concocting master and a pill concocting master received a lot of requests to concoct pills for some payment. This was a common practice in the cultivation world. Only, nobody could guarantee success, and the ingredients were also invested by the requestor.

Speaking frankly, pill concocting masters use materials gathered by others to practice their skill and increase their experience and also earn some profit by selling that pill. This was not very strange. All of the pill concocting masters followed this practice. Making the pill concocting master gather their own materials was simply wasting their precious time.
