Demanding their master’s and young master’s life, how could the people of auction house agree? Perhaps the master could be abandoned, but who would dare to abandon the young master? Their only choice was to fight to the death.

The problem was that the enemy did not give them this chance. While the master and the young master were still hesitating, the ground suddenly opened up and engulfed both of them. No matter that they were both at the peak JieDan stage, all struggle was in vain and they mysteriously disappeared in front of everyone’s eyes, leaving behind a group of guards and administrative people, poking the place as if they were dreaming.

This time the people of the auction house were in great trouble. The master was still expendable, but the young master was also taken away and moreover, as everyone had heard, the intention of the enemy was to take the young master’s life. If the owner knew about this, all of the guards of the auction house could forget about leaving there alive.
