Originally Yang Chen wanted to use the excuse of hunting Chu Heng as a pretext of going to the Desolate Valley, but at the moment Yang Chen was hell bent on killing him. Never before had Yang Chen felt such an intense desire to get rid of this person. Chu Heng had gone too far by daring to insult his master, even a hundred deaths could not pardon his crime!

Gao Yue had never seen Yang Chen angry before, so she did not know that Yang Chen would be this frightening when he was angry. It seemed to her that since Yang Chen was calm towards Chu Heng words insulting him, he would not be angry like this. But she hadnâ€™t thought that just a single line which had been directed at her and Yang Chen would make him so angry.

But Yang Chen getting angry because of Chu Heng insulting her had given her a kind of happiness, which could not be explained with words. Apart from her master, Wang Yong, Gao Yue never received this kind of concern from any other person, and Yang Chen had even remained indifferent to the abuses on himself while she herself had felt injustice at the wrongful abuse.
