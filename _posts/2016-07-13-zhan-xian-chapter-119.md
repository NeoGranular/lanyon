“An instant cultivation method, regardless of the results in cultivation would certainly bring unsteadiness to your mind.”

Gao Yue shook her head:

“The deeper the cultivation, the more serious the heart’s devil. Cultivating quickly leaves behind many dangers, thus the losses do not make up for the gains. This is certainly a cultivation technique of the devil path and you must not be infected by it by any means!”

“Elder Wu had only said there had been some development regarding this matter, but didn’t tell me anything specific.”

Yang Chen was using ambiguous words to speak about this matter as much as possible:

“Do not support the Palace Master’s suggestions regarding this matter, in the future if this kind of matter appears, by all means try to restrict the disciples of the sect from such a cultivation method, ok?”

Yang Chen’s aim was making Gao Yue get the Pure Yang Palace out of a predicament. In his previous life, Gao Yue was the hall master of the Fierce Yang Hall, but unfortunately she had died an untimely death. In this life Yang Chen had to make her the most influential person in the Pure Yang Palace, he had to make Gao Yue aim for being the leader of the Pure Yang Palace. Naturally she had to constantly accumulate prestige for this every day.
