Yang Chen’s act was monitored by the master of the auction house all along. The master’s room was the center of the entire auction house, inside there, not only could he see the auction of every object, he could also find out everything happening in any room at the same time.

When Yang Chen was paying for the Heaven Measuring Ruler, he did not pull out scattered pieces to make up the catty of high grade spirit stones, instead he had first pulled out a complete piece of extremely bright top grade spirit stone. Then he put it back in and took out a pile of scattered spirit stones to pay.

Everyone in the auction knew about Yang Chen’s situation. Moreover, Yang Chen would always enter the bidding competition, this made it sufficiently clear that Yang Chen wanted these things. After some objects had been auctioned, Yang Chen had clearly established his image as a rich person who had an inferior cultivation and lacked experience.
