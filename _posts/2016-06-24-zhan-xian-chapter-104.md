Making the demonic beasts believe that he was also a demonic beast was impossible for other people, but Yang Chen was an exception, especially after he had cultivated to the third layer of the three purities secrets. 

The cyan ox had also given Yang Chen a copy of the final stage, so Yang Chen was completely sure that this was not the method of the Beast Controlling Sect, Yang Chen doubted it was something the cyan ox had added. The most unexpected thing was that this section was like a copy of his own cultivation method for cultivating his Spiritual Awareness. This small copy of the cultivation method, although it was a method to cultivate Spiritual Awareness, it would also allow him to sufficiently imitate the smell of cyan ox himself. 

The most important thing was that Yang Chen wouldn’t have even been able to comprehend this method, if he hadn’t cultivated to the third layer of layer of three purities secrets, let alone cultivating the method. But fortunately Yang Chen had received the cultivation method of the three purities secrets from the Greatest Supreme Elder, and he had also already cultivated it to the third layer.
