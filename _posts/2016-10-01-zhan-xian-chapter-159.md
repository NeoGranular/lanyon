“What do you want?”

Scarface knew that Yang Chen would certainly not refine that Face Changing Pill for him without any good cause. That pill which could even cause an inconvenience to the Greatest Heaven Sect couldn’t be produced so easily.

“If you go to the area of demon beasts or devil cultivators and find some materials, I will have the right to purchase it first.”

Yang Chen’s request was not that difficult. Actually he provided Scarface with a way to make money.

“Those places are rich in natural resources, so you can get a group of people and get some commissions from the sects here and then trade the things you find at those places.”

Yang Chen said a few more enticing words:

“In any case, you like to run around, so maybe it will increase your knowledge and experience and at the same time, earn you some wealth.”
