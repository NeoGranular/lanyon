The things Elder Wu promised were different for different people, otherwise he would not be honoring their commitment. But Yang Chen was also suspicious in that his performance this time was too excessive, so Elder Wu may not know how to reward Yang Chen all of a sudden, therefore he could only send him back personally for the time being.

Elder Wu had taken Yang Chen away so hurriedly because he feared that these three would use his influence to ask Yang Chen for the recipe to manufacture the fine powder he had used to nourished the pill spirit, which would lead to a disagreement between Yang Chen and them; so after the refining had been successful, he immediately took Yang Chen and departed. The other people would not leave alone without his instructions, and even if they wanted to leave, they could only leave after he had arranged for Yang Chen. To put it crudely, they would have a hard time breaking the tens of layer of restrictions he placed.

Elder Wu hadnâ€™t expected much help from Yang Chen during the refining, but he actually ended up rescuing the pill. Among the most reputed pill concocting masters in this mortal world, only a handful of people could do something like that.
