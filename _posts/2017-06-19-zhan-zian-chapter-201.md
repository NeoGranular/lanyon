The people of the Second Fierce Yang Courtyard were very fortunate., Nnot only did they get to cultivate in the best environment, but now they also had the opportunity to experience and observe the lightening tribulation of after a JieDan expert who had formed his Ying. This was basically getting educated through observation., Wwat learning opportunity could be better  compared to this?

 As for the part of Second Fierce Yang Courtyard which had been destroyed, there was nothing to worry about. Only Yang Chen, Gao Yue, some of Yang Chen’s senior apprentice brothers, and their servants had participated in the construction of the initial Second Fierce Yang Courtyard. Presently, Palace Master Zhong Jiao simply waved his hand and assigned the sect’s builders, using natural resources, to repair the entire courtyard properly. Compared to initial one, the courtyard this time will be constructed more spectacularly. 

All the elders were happy, Palace Master Zhong Jiao was also happy, and all the other disciples were happy. Under such extreme happiness, Palace Master Zhong Jiao decided to celebrate Hall Master Zhu becoming a YuanYing stage expert by giving every disciple an additional allotment of their monthly elixir allowance, regardless if they were an inner or outer sect disciple.
