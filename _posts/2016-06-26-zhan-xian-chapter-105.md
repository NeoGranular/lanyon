Hearing Yang Chen’s words provoking them, how could the three not understand that Yang Chen had already seen through them. The leading youth was alarmed, not able to deal with him anymore, he said in loud voice:

'Let’s fight!'

The flying sword under his feet already separated from him and turned into a sword light, flying towards Yang Chen, who standing in front of them. Two more flying swords, from the two behind him, also flew directly towards Yang Chen’s position. In a flash, Yang Chen would be pierced by three flying swords together. 

In the time it took for a flint to strike a spark, the sand dune beneath Yang Chen’s feet began to transform and in a moment rose to more than ten meters high, lifting Yang Chen with it. 

The three flying swords issued three ear piercing sounds and under their masters’ control they took a huge turn within the sky and continued towards Yang Chen’s rising body to stab him.
