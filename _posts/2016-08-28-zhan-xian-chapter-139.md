What Gao Yue and Yang Chen hadn’t seen was that the Palace Master and Wang Yong who were returning had stopped mid way.

The Palace Master found a flat region to sit and then put up a restriction spell. The Palace Master then said to Wang Yong, who had been following just behind him:

“Senior disciple, this grand disciple of yours really leaves people speechless!”

“Are you envious?”

Wang Yong and Palace Master had a relationship of fellow apprentices, so in private they were more casual compared to when they were in front of people:

“Being envious is useless, it was just my good luck that I have such a good Grand Disciple!”
