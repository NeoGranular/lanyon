Let alone others, Yang Chen had at least killed seven to eight people just at the Desolate Valley: a few at the place of the earth attributed beast, another two JieDan stage experts, one was Chu Heng, all of this was not unknown to the demon beasts.

Hearing Yang Chen’s reply and thinking about Yang Chen’s actions, the two demon beasts apparently realized everything and didn’t nag much about the  question of killing people. Regarding the matter of killing people, Yang Chen had certainly not said any false words.

But Yang Chen’s last words made them think about this carefully. As demon beasts who had lived for a long time at the Desolate Valley, they knew better than most people about how demon beasts were looked at by human cultivators. If it was not that they were determined as targets, so that the disciples could temper themselves and given a fixed territory, in all likelihood, they would have been killed already.
