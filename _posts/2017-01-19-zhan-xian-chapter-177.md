Before anyone could say anything, Yang Chen had already comforted the Da Cheng stage old tree demon? Moreover, what was he even saying? Trouble Yang Chen at the time of his ascension?

Although Yang Chen had given Wang Yong a Heaven Seizing Pill, but this kind of thing could only be found by accident and not by searching, how was it possible for him to have so many that he could give them away as gifts? Moreover, Yang Chen was a foundation stage expert and surprisingly, the old tree demon wanted to rely on him to ascend? Naturally, this could scare anyone.

Although Yang Chen defied their limits of tolerance everytime, when a genuine Da Cheng stage expert asked for help so earnestly, they were still a bit intimidated.
