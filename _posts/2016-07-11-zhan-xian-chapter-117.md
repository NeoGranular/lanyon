Once these words came out of Yang Chen’s mouth, it immediately gave rise to nervousness on the part of the three other people. How could he speak with Elder Wu in this kind of tone? Elder Wu had agreed to hear him, that was already heaven defying luck, but still going so far as to haggle over the price? Even if everyone in the entire Pure Yang Palace was counted, nobody would have any doubt that Elder Wu was extremely clear about what he wanted!

Elder Wu’s complexion was formal, his gaze as cold as ice, glaring at Yang Chen. A noiseless pressure appeared and shrouded Yang Chen.

Even though it did not spread to the other people, the Palace Master, Wang Yong and Gao Yue still felt a chill. The pressure exerted by a peak Da Cheng stage expert, even if it was them, they would still be frightened stiff.
