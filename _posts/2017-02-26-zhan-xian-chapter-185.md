The reality also didn’t allow Gongsun Ling to insist on using the just and honourable method, she was foundation stage disciple and the enemy was a JieDan stage expert. If she confronted him openly, then that is not preserving on principle rather plain foolishness.

When Gongsun Ling’s five phases sword spell formation suddenly started attacking a JieDan stage expert responsible for the coiling spell, Gao Yue also quickly revealed herself to obstruct another JieDan expert wanting to lend help to his friend.

As for those foundation stage clansmen, they were all delivered to Yang Chen. Although no one knew how Yang Chen will deal with them, but Gao Yue and Gongsun Ling had never even doubted once that Yang Chen would not be able to easily take care of them.
