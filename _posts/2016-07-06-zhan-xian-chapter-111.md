The Meadow Viper also transformed into a middle aged man, but he had a somewhat tender appearance, compared to the Sand Scorpion he seemed a little bit young. On his body was an armour made up of his scales, giving an impression that he was much gentler than Sand Scorpion.

The sight of the Meadow Viper was not very good and the Sand Scorpion was similar, the two demon beasts seemed to be dissatisfied over being cheated by Yang Chen. Previously they couldn't see it, but Yang Chen's manner of absorbing the fifth earth True Qi was completely different from them, this made them realize the truth.

“Yes, I am a human cultivator!”

In this situation, Yang Chen did not hide anything about himself.

“I am Yang Chen, inner disciple of Pure Yang Palace! I once again greet you two seniors!”
