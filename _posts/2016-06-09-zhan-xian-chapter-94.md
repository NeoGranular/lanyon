Gao Yue absolutely hadn’t anticipated this. The Palace Master put in so much effort for Yang Chen, and at the moment he was sitting calmly, not saying anything else, merely observing the responses of everyone around him.

Those people who had previously supported Liang Shao Ming also reacted at this moment. If they agreed to Liang Shao Ming’s proposal of seizing Yang Chen’s discovered Di Mai today, then tomorrow they might find even their own things being taken away. The Palace Master had clearly thought about this problem and concluded that Liang Shao Ming would not agree to this proposal.

Liang Shao Ming himself also hadn’t come to a decision. If he wanted to take Yang Chen’s Di Mai to be assigned to and be shared with the sect, then his own top grade sword would also be snatched by others to be shared with the sect. The problem with the Di Mai’s Spirit Power could be solved by letting people absorb it, but if the flying sword was given to other people, it would certainly lead them to ascend without leaving anything behind.
