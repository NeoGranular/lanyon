Gao Yue was also regretfully awakened by Wang Yongâ€™s happy voice, but she had also benefitted. Just the events of this pill tribulation had allowed her to become more knowledgeable, thanks to being able to directly observe the three calamities. This had given her many benefits regarding her tribulations in the future.

Currently Wang Yong did not know how to describe this grand disciple of his. As soon as they met with him, he had given such a pleasant surprise to the Palace Master and the elders. Penglai Divine Wood, a Third Grade Divine Wood Foundation Stage Pill, being a Third Grade Pill Concocting Master, and now also the Heaven Seizing Pill and these pill tribulations.

He must have surely gotten the Penglai Divine Wood from Elder Wu, after all Yang Chen was just a foundation stage disciple, how else would he be able to obtain it? Elder Wu had been so generous to give him the Heaven Seizing Pill, so  obviously he would not think much about giving him a small piece of Penglai Divine Wood, but that little branch of Penglai Divine Wood was very important for the Pure Yang Palace. If they were able to breed it, after several hundred or thousand years, the Pure Yang Palace would be able to produce many treasures.
