* To see the site with a white background and black text, put a tick  in the side menu ( â˜° ) here: "â˜‘ Light Theme".
* Our site is *almost* fully functional without JavaScript. We use JavaScript for changing themes, disqus comments, AdSense and Analytics.
* You can comment as guest in disqus, but we will manually approve guest comments by hand, so it may take some time for them to appear.
* On mobile, you can switch the font-size between regular and large by clicking on the icons in the bottom left corner.
