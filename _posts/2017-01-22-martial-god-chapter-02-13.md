In the mountain forest, a gigantic air-cleaving sound suddenly rang out. As a swift, majestic white light flashed, a huge fox bear’s head rolled down before it could even make a sound.

Two fox bears had teamed up to mount a sneak attack on a certain individual in the mountain forest. However, they didn’t expect that just by a casual wave of that individual’s hand, one of them would lose its head as soon as they revealed themselves.

The other one trembled from head to toe. It could smell the odour of death. The human who had seemed completely harmless a moment ago, this moment, exuded such a dangerous feeling that it couldn’t help but shiver uncontrollably.
