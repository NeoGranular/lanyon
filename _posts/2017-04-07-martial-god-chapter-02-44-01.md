After leaving his eldest uncle’s residence, He Yiming went to his own room, grabbed the Reclining Moon blade, and once again headed towards the mountains.

After learning that Lu Xinwen was a Xiantian cultivator, although he was not afraid in the slightest, he didn’t dare be carefree or neglectful either.

If he were to be neglectful and withholding even while confronting a Xiantian cultivator, it wouldn’t be any different than courting death.

He Yiming’s current most powerful martial skill was undoubtedly [Splitting Mountain Thirty Six Forms]. Furthermore, the use of this technique was not limited to palm techniques and could even be used with blade techniques.
