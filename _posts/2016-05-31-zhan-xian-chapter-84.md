When they had left Li Lou village, the Heavenly Fleeing Shuttle had taken a time of more than a day to reach the villa where Elder Wu was refining the herbs, but while returning it had only taken them the time to chat for some time and drink a few cups of tea. From this, it could be seen that Elder Wu had gained great benefits during this pill concoction.

Elder Wu didn’t appear at Li Lou village himself, instead he directly dropped Yang Chen off at his small room. Because Elder Wu’s cultivation was that high, nobody was able to discover him. Everyone could at most sense that Yang Chen had suddenly appeared out of thin air there.
