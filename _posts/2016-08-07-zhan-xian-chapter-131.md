Sun QingXue had been able to come over because of her relationship with Yang Chen, but she hadn’t anticipated this kind of situation and immediately cried out in fear.

“Who is losing their head? Why has she come here!”

One elder watching the situation inside, berated Sun QingXue hearing her shout.
