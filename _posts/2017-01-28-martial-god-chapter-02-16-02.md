In Tai Cang county, He Yiming had always repressed his true strength because he didn’t wish his grandfather, father, and other elders to discover his true strength.

The progress of his strength had been too quick- to the extent that even he himself sometimes felt skeptical. In all honesty, he actually might be treated as a devil for real. Even if he somehow made them empathize with his situation, the word ‘genius’ alone still wouldn’t be able to cover the explanation.

Consequently, if he had to reveal his fortuitous event at the bottom of the lake, the further development would spiral out of his control.
