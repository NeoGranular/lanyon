Although experts from every sect had surrounded the area with a radius of a hundred miles, all of them were lying low and had concealed their presence, waiting for Lin Chenghe to trigger the heavenly tribulation.

But while all of them were hoping, this was just their wishful thinking. Yang Chen knew that, not only would Lin Chenghe survive the tribulation and enter the Da Cheng stage, he would also take away the cultivation of those Da Cheng stage experts and would only die from the backlash he would suffer from absorbing too much spirit power.

So after all was said and done, Lin Chenghe finally died because of his own actions, which were not influenced by the dao sects very much. If one absolutely wanted to prove a trace of a relationship, then it would only be the pressure which the dao sects had put on him to absorb this large amount of spirit power in a short time, nothing more. If he hadnâ€™t become underconfident at that time, then he would definitely not have faced this kind of problem.
