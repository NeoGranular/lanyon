Yang Chen did not encounter any trouble on the road to the Clear Sky Sect. Flying on his flying sword, he also hadn’t seen any people until he had entered the region under the influence of the Clear Sky Sect.

The Clear Sky Sect was also situated near a major city, only it was still in a mountain area. In the opinion of these people, the Clear Sky Sect was at most a cultivation sect.

Yang Chen also hadn’t thought that he would meet the Xue Wu Fairy, famous in the future, under such circumstances.
