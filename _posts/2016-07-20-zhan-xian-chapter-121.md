This cave at the seabed was a secret treasure house which the Dragon King had told Yang Chen about, when he was beheading him. This huge open space at the bottom of the sea was also a magic tool to control the ocean within the palace of the Dragon King at the bottom of the sea, the East Sea Nautical Map.

The East Sea Nautical Map was able to illustrate all mountains or creeks above the sea bed, even including the topography of the sea bed. On top of it was the distribution of formidable ocean beasts and at the same time also the distribution of Spirit Veins within the ocean.

Those bright spots were precisely the distribution within the East Sea, every bright spot meant a spirit vein and the size and the illumination expressed the spirit power concentration of the spirit vein, the more larger the more brighter, also represented clearly that the spirit vein had increasingly more spirit power.
