When only the master root was left, Yang Chen stopped. This was the most crucial step. As long as he succeeded, it implied that elder Hua Wanting would not have endure further torment from the blood phantom root, but this was also the most challenging step and he wouldn’t be able to achieve it with just medicinal power and spirit power.

If he just wanted to remove Elder Hua Wanting’s pain and resolve the blood phantom vine, it was still comparatively simple, but the problem was that Yang Chen wanted to use this opportunity and wanted to collect this blood phantom vine’s root, which, although it had sucked the blood of a Da Cheng stage expert, was still only in it’s infancy. This was going to be a lot more troublesome.

Naturally, for Yang Chen, this was not an impossible task, this was a good opportunity to show his friendship towards the Clear Sky Sect to seek benefits and furthermore an opportunity to conceal his aim. Otherwise, in case they found out that he had collected the blood phantom vine, it would actually increase his troubles in the future rather than decreasing them.
