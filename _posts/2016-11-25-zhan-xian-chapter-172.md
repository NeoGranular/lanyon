This trip to annihilate Lin Chenghe had simply brought great fame and fortune for Yang Chen. Regardless of whatever had happened, in the end, Yang Chen’s name was still written together with those Da Cheng and YuanYing stage experts, although it was only written at the last place.

In the end, the expert from the Pure Yang Palace, aside from looking weaker in front of others, as well as Yang Chen getting some credit, Gui Shanyou’s name also spread far and wide.

Pure Yang Palace’s Eccentric Hall’s hall master, had not only accurately discovered the position of Lin Chenghe, allowing everyone to surround him, but also, at the crucial time, had saved the lives of more than ten YuanYing stage experts. Such a contribution was indeed one of the largest.
