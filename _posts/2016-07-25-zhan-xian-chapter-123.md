Yang Chen had underestimated his position within Yong Zhu’s mind, as soon as his figure emerged on the beach, he immediately heard Yong Zhu’s surprised voice.

“Grandmaster Yang! Myself has waited for you for two whole months!”

Just as Yang Chen had put away his flying sword, Yong Zhu’s voice reached his ears. Immediately looking over, Yong Zhu’s figure appeared in his view.

“Sorry for the troubles, Fellow Daoist Yong!”

Yang Chen smiled, this Yong Zhu had waited for him, so this much courtesy was normal. Although Yang Chen had killed a lot of people, he was still not someone who did not understand the ways of the world.
