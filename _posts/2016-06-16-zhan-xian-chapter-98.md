Replacing a thin, minor root with a master root was naturally a completely different concept. This kind of common sense, even an ordinary person was able to understand it. Naturally, cultivators understood the difference between the accumulated Spirit Power, as well as the difference between their functions even more clearly.

Yang Chen had begun with four pills, they were merely tests after all and still far from genuinely refined foundation stage pills. This time, Yang Chen was even more serious and the refining time was longer by two or three times.

Naturally, the cause of the long duration was the time needed to refine the master root of the Penglai Divine Wood, which was many times longer and it was also more difficult compared to refining the small, minor root. Just this one step had taken a few months for Yang Chen. Even still, this was the result of Yang Chen controlling the Real Sun Fire with all of his strength, the strength of the master root could clearly be ascertained from this.
