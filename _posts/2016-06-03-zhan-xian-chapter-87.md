All of the wood attributed ingredients and herbs, regardless of whether they were of the first wood or the second wood, began to grow frantically almost at the same time, as if they had been catalyzed. Within a short period of time, they were as lush as those which had been growing in the medicine garden for hundreds of years.

During this violent vibration, the space of the medicine garden, while appearing slow, was actually expanding quickly. The originally many hundred hectares of space had expanded to two to three times under this great change.

In the large open space surrounding the medicinal farm, faintly observable, small streams appeared out of nowhere, converged at the medicinal farms and afterwards flowed in another direction. Nobody would know from where this stream came and to where it would go, but it had already turned into running water.
