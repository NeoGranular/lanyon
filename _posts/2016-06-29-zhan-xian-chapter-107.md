For demon beasts, if they couldn’t probe successfully, they would change their ways, among demon beasts, there was no fight to the death if they were not fighting over territory, natural resources or prey. If there was a large difference in strength, then perhaps the powerful one could forcefully subdue the weaker one, but if the strength of both sides did not have a large discrepancy then the best method was to negotiate. The demon beasts were no fools, most of all those under the covetous eyes of the cultivators in the Desolate Valley.

Yang Chen could sense what the Meadow Viper was thinking, since he had directly swallowed its killing intent without paying any attention, naturally he was not much weaker. Since Yang Chen was merely asking for directions and did not have any intentions of harming it in any way, it naturally would not immediately attack him, it wanted to find the secret behind Yang Chen being able to turn into a human, naturally it would not mind paying some price.

Although the Meadow Viper had already learned how to hide it’s appearance at this stage, that was merely its innate instinct. It also hadn’t learned how to hide its strength, but it was very clear about this point. Regular cultivators who were not equal to it, were intimidated by that sort of killing intent, but Yang Chen was different, that was naturally a great trouble for him.
