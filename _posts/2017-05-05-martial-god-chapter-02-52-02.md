Under his gaze, He Yiming’s brows slightly creased. He was exceptionally displeased with this gaze.

“So, you’ve come after all. Didn’t expect you can even keep the senior granduncle in the dark,” His voice seemed to be coming from in between his teeth; the hate within apparent to whoever heard it.

Since He Yiming had come looking for him, the former must have heard his final words, and since He Yiming knew his intentions, he had no chance.

“That’s right, I’ve come.” Looking at Lu Xinwen, who had already closed his eyes, He Yiming slowly said, “In fact, he didn’t have to die at all. If your Fan family had not coveted Yuan family’s assets, him, his three disciples, your father, and you….nobody needed to die.”
