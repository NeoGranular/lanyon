When Cheng Wencai had identified Yang Chen, this JieDan stage expert of Greatest Heaven Sect didn’t have any clue of what’s going on. How could he have imagine that in this region where there were apparently no signs of human habitation, how could the person who he wanted to kill be so nonchalant? 

From beginning to end, Yang Chen had remained seated on top of the tree without even changing his posture. When Cheng Wencai’s spiritual awareness was probing all sides, Yang Chen’s formidable spiritual awareness had also probed this area, and Fan Shan had already returned to this side. 

Even though he was only at foundation stage, Yang Chen was curing senior black tiger, moreover was also personally escorting the Black Tiger Suppressing Elixir with him to Beast Taming Sect to stabilize the injury of senior black tiger. How could Fan Shan let Cheng Wencai injure Yang Chen so easily? Fan Shan had established the relationship of a brother with Yang Chen with great difficulty, how could he let Cheng Wencai destroy it so easily?
