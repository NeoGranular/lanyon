The tower’s gate slowly opened, and He Yiming’s figure suddenly appeared outside the gate. He turned back and performed a deep bow towards the insides of the tower. Subsequently, he waved his sleeves and immediately left, walking towards the entrance of the Royal Palace.

All the guards had already been commanded to pretended as if they hadn’t seen anything regarding He Yiming’s departure. However, they wouldn’t have been able to stop even if they wished.

A few moments later, He Yiming had left the Royal Palace. However, right at this moment, Ting Brightfire appeared in the tower himself.

“Ancestor, has Master He agreed to serve as our Fire Crow country’s national protector?”
