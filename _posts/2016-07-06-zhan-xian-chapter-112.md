Chu Heng felt that his life had a lot of twists and turns: just because of an insignificant youngster named Yang Chen he had surprisingly turned into a traitor of the sect from a person who had boundless prospects and was the successor disciple of Luminous Moon Hall’s master. He was really unable to accept this huge reversal.

Everything was because of that damned Yang Chen! If it were not for Yang Chen, how could Chu Heng have ended in the current situation? Once he recalled that repulsive face of Yang Chen, Chu Heng was unable to restrain himself from clenching his fists.

After he had turned into a traitor and the Law Enforcement Hall had come looking for him, Chu Heng did not want to be captured helplessly. If he was taken back, there was only one option for him: death. Because Yang Chen had helped Elder Wu refine the Heaven Seizing Pill, Yang Chen’s importance vastly surpassed Chu Heng at the Pure Yang Palace.
