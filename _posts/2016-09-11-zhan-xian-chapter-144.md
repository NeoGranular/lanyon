Not only Shangguan Feng, but She Kui and Xie Sha also felt a coldness as if they had been suddenly placed in the world of ice and snow, where people couldn’t stop shivering.

Everyone suddenly discovered that the source of the cold air was Yang Chen. But all three of them very quickly understood that this was not any cold air, but killing intent. The frightening killing intent surprisingly made all three of them sense a chill in their bodies.

She Kui and Xie Sha were still better, but Shangguan Feng jaw began to clatter. Xie Sha discovered that there was something wrong and hastily yelled:

“What are you up to? It was not Shangguan who attacked your master!”
