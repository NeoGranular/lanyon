On that evening, a big banquet was held in the Yuan family. Not only had all the core members of the young generation scattered in various regions been called back, even some of the personnels engaged in important tasks had been called back to the manor.

The old man was clearly borrowing He Quanxin and the others to suppress his clansmen, who had begun to stir.

He Quanxin and the others knew this old manâ€™s objective, but it also happened to conform to their objective in coming here. Therefore, currently, even He Yiming, who would wish rather to not be the center attraction, could only sit among the principal seats like a statue with a smile forced out on his face, like his eldest uncle.

On the other hand, He Yitian was quite suited for this occasion. His conduct was commendable, winning a favourable impression from them.
