It is impossible to cultivate without a spiritual root
Spiritual roots appear at an auspicious time
Spiritual roots affect the affinity of cultivating in a given attribute
*Note there are 5 attributes wood, fire, earth, metal, water and each can be further divided into two different types for each attribute (Yin and Yang type concept)
Different attributes restrain each other such as fire and water. Based on Chinese mythology. 

There are also post natal spirit roots like the water attributed one which Gao Yue, they are acquired and are not innate. Like Yang Chen's spirit roots except for the fire one are all acquired.

Cultivator ranks can be divided into multiple different realms. The ones that have been mentioned so far are: Qi levels, Foundation Stage, JieDan, YuanYing, DaCheng
The term realm usually refers to the different stages of cultivation in reference to each other
Cultivators should consolidate themselves after a major breakthrough
